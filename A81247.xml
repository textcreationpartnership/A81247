            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119240:3"/> proſtituted to <hi>baſer objects.</hi> When the <hi>world</hi> gets the ſtart of <hi>Religion</hi> in the Morning, it can hardly overtake it all the day; and ſo the heart is <hi>habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to <hi>vanity all the day long;</hi> but when we <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with God,</hi> we take him along with us to all the <hi>buſineſſes</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> of the day; which being ſeaſoned with his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> are the more ſweet and ſavory to us.</p>
            <p>If there were no other benefit of the <hi>Morning Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,</hi> than to be an help to us in this <hi>ſetting the mind on work</hi> upon <hi>holy things,</hi> before it receive taint from the <hi>world,</hi> and the diſtraction of our <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary affairs,</hi> it ſhould upon that account be a very <hi>welcome gueſt</hi> to our <hi>dwellings.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The rather I urge this, becauſe the Exerciſes of this Month have not been ordinary <hi>Morning Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,</hi> but all the <hi>Arguments</hi> were <hi>picked</hi> and <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> (as <hi>the Preacher ſought to finde out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable words,</hi> even <hi>words of truth,</hi> Eccl. <hi>12.10.</hi>) and diſpoſed into a certain <hi>order</hi> for the greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
<pb facs="tcp:119240:4"/> It is obſerved that the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> that are <hi>alphabetically diſpoſed,</hi> are <hi>moſt exact</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure; ſo I hope I may ſay without offence, theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons digeſted into a <hi>method,</hi> are the more accurate; with what perſpicuity and ſtrength they are managed, as to the <hi>Doctrinal part,</hi> and with what <hi>warmth</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour</hi> as to the <hi>Application,</hi> I cannot ſpeak, being ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyned ſilence by my Brethrens ſevere modeſty; but the <hi>World will judge,</hi> and you I hope will <hi>evidence</hi> by your own <hi>growth in grace, and the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons which with ſo greedy attention you formerly heard with the <hi>hearing of the ear,</hi> are now written <hi>for a memorial;</hi> and that they may be ſubjected to your <hi>view</hi> and more <hi>deliberate conſideration:</hi> I ſay they are written not only for the <hi>Churches uſe,</hi> but yours in <hi>ſpecial;</hi> and oh that they may be written upon your hearts, engraven there with a durable Character, ſuch as ſhall never be defaced!</p>
            <p>Honourable and Beloved, <hi>I</hi> hope I need not preſſe any of you to get theſe books into your houſes; I can eaſily preſume it of the <hi>abler ſort</hi> amongſt you; and would earneſtly preſſe it upon the <hi>meaneſt,</hi> even the <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> in your Families, that they would abate not only of <hi>ſuperfluous expences,</hi> but deny themſelves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, even of their <hi>ordinary conveniences,</hi> to purchaſe theſe <hi>Sermons;</hi> which, if the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> ſhould <hi>fail,</hi> (a
<pb facs="tcp:119240:5"/> judgement which <hi>England</hi> was never in ſuch danger of ſince the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was <hi>reſtored</hi>) and all other <hi>helps</hi> both in <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> and <hi>private</hi> ſhould be <hi>cut</hi> off, which God <hi>forbid;</hi> yet this <hi>one Book, next to your Bible,</hi> would be a <hi>ſtock of Divinity</hi> which might furniſh you with the knowledge of the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Religion, and be like <hi>Manna</hi> to you in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi> till you come to <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that end therefore, that which I would with <hi>greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe</hi> urge upon you, is to get the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the truths contained in them into your hearts, and ſo to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them, eſpecially the general heads of them upon your <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and <hi>ſervants,</hi> that they may be trained up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe <hi>vital principles,</hi> which are of ſuch uſe for the begetting and increaſing of the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power of godlineſſe.</hi> It will be ſad, if what was chiefly intended for your uſe, ſhould finde <hi>leaſt fruit</hi> amongſt you; and that which is a <hi>common good,</hi> ſhould be not a <hi>Monument</hi> only, but the <hi>aggravation</hi> of your <hi>unfruitfulneſſe.</hi>
            </p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot to increaſe the number of Books already grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a burden, and more apt to diſtract minds with their <hi>variety,</hi> than to <hi>edifie</hi> them with their Contents; but for a <hi>publick teſtimony</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and to inform the ignorant, doth this <hi>Piece</hi> crowd into the World. Had many of the <hi>Brethren</hi> adhered to their own private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and firſt aime in this work, theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> had only been publiſhed by <hi>word of mouth</hi> to the <hi>Auditory</hi> that then attended on them. To write to the World, is apprehended by them as a thing very diſtinct from <hi>preaching</hi> to a company of a few <hi>broken-hearted Chriſtians,</hi> (who were willing to take this help along with them in their way to heaven) and to need more exactneſſe of <hi>care</hi> and <hi>preparation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But upon the ſtrong importunity of the Auditors, (ſome of them perſons of great worth and honour) carrying with it the face of a <hi>Call from God,</hi> as valid as that which firſt invited them to the work, they were contented againſt their <hi>own private incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to yield to this way of publication for the <hi>profit of others;</hi> but with theſe <hi>CAUTIONS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it be ſignified, that it was not intended to make up <hi>a Map</hi> or <hi>Compleat Body</hi> of Divine Truths, but only to handle ſome more <hi>neceſſary points,</hi> till Providence ſhall give opportunity to conſider the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it was not deſigned to diſcuſſe theſe points in <hi>a Polemical,</hi> but <hi>poſitive</hi> way; and ſutable to <hi>a popular Auditory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it be underſtood that the <hi>Brethren</hi> that preached, were not acquainted with <hi>one anothers ſtudies;</hi> but did every one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his <hi>own ſenſe</hi> in the <hi>point</hi> recommended to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That this be not interpreted to be the work of the
<pb facs="tcp:119240:6"/> 
               <hi>whole Body</hi> of the <hi>London-Miniſters,</hi> but of <hi>ſome</hi> of them, which they repreſent with the <hi>more tenderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Partly,</hi> that the other very <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> who were not employed in this <hi>Turn</hi> and <hi>Courſe</hi> of the <hi>Morning Exerciſe,</hi> may not be charged with their weakneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Partly,</hi> becauſe they have not without ſome <hi>regret</hi> obſerved that the larger <hi>Engliſh Annotations,</hi> in which but ſome few only of the <hi>late Aſſembly,</hi> together with ſome others, had an hand, are generally aſcribed to the <hi>whole Aſſembly,</hi> and uſually carry the name of the <hi>Aſsemblies Annotations,</hi> as if done by the <hi>joynt advice</hi> of that <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>learned convention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That ſince the preaching of theſe Sermons, there hath been no <hi>general review,</hi> but every one took care of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing <hi>his own Diſcourſe,</hi> and ſending me the <hi>Copy,</hi> accordingly I ſent it to the <hi>Preſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That if any of theſe points ſeem not to be diſcuſſed according to the full <hi>latitude</hi> and <hi>worthineſs</hi> of the <hi>ſubject,</hi> it be remembred that each Exerciſe was to be punctually confined within the ſtraits of <hi>an houre;</hi> in which time there was no room for <hi>larger excurſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the ſeverity of theſe terms, my Brethren have conſented that I ſhould (if I ſaw fit) expoſe their labours to <hi>publick view,</hi> which I do with all chearfulneſſe; <hi>Partly,</hi> that the world may be conſcious to our <hi>Unity, ſoundneſſe in the faith,</hi> and <hi>ſobriety af judgement:</hi> And <hi>partly</hi> expecting from thence (I will ſay it, notwithſtanding the reſtraints their modeſty hath laid upon me) <hi>no ſmall increaſe and return of fruit.</hi> The Lord by his good Spirit guide you into all truth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The whole Scripture is a large Module of ſaving truth. Joh. 18.37.</note>The whole <hi>Goſpel</hi> (in general) is nothing but the great <hi>Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> or <hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>ſaving doctrine.</hi> It was the great <hi>end</hi> and <hi>errand</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his coming into the world, to reveal unto us the <hi>truth of God;</hi> ſo himſelf teſtifieth, <hi>John</hi> 18.37. <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe I came into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſſe unto the truth.</hi> It took <hi>up one whole entire office,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he was anointed of his Father; his <hi>Prophetical Office;</hi> ſo he was named many hundred years before his <hi>Incarnation</hi> by <hi>Moſes: A <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, like unto me, him ſhall you hear.</hi> The <hi>office of a Prophet</hi> was not only to <hi>foretell</hi> things to come;<note place="margin">As Exod. 7.1. <hi>Aaron</hi> is call'd.</note> but to <hi>reveal the mind of God,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the import of the Hebrew word <hi>Nabi,</hi> which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an <hi>Interpreter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Jeſus Chriſt came to be an <hi>Interpreter</hi> of his Fathers <hi>mind</hi> unto the world. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time; the onely begotten Sonne which is in the boſome of the Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.18.</note>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he hath <hi>expounded him;</hi> The whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which Chriſt preached was nothing elſe as it were but a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick testimony</hi> of the <hi>ſecret tranſactions</hi> between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> concerning mans ſalvation; a tranſcript of that truth which was in the <hi>divine underſtanding</hi> from all eternity, John 8.38. &amp; 15.15.</p>
            <p>And accordingly it is obſervable that the Sermons which Chriſt preached in the <hi>days of his fleſh,</hi> have more of <hi>doctirne in them,</hi> than of <hi>perſwaſion;</hi> more of the <hi>Teacher,</hi> than of the <hi>Paſtor;</hi> as more ſutable to his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> wherein he was to lay down a Module of <hi>Gospel-truth;</hi> and to leave it to the world, to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and believed unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The credit of our Religion is founded upon this important truth, that Chriſt was ſent from God to reveal unto us the <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> and to be believed in all he delivered unto us; all other Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpel are but <hi>Deputy Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> to make report of Chriſts <hi>affidavit</hi> to the doctrine of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And it is yet further remarkable, that this doctrine which Jeſus Chriſt left us in the Goſpel, is nothing elſe as it were, but<note n="*" place="margin">Novum Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere velatum, vetus in novo revelatum.</note> a <hi>Comment</hi> or Paraphraſe of what was preached by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119240:10"/> 
               <hi>Prophets</hi> in the Old Teſtament; as he came<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 5.18.</note> not <hi>to deſtroy</hi> the Law and the Prophets, but <hi>to fulfill them;</hi> ſo he came to <hi>expound</hi> and <hi>reconcile</hi> them with the doctrine which he <hi>himſelf taught;</hi> thus it is recorded by the Evangeliſt, that<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 24.27.</note> 
               <hi>beginning at Moſes, he <hi>expounded</hi> unto his Diſciples in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf.</hi> So that the reſult of all this in <hi>general,</hi> is this, that the holy <hi>Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament</hi> are nothing elſe but a <hi>full and perfect platform</hi> or <hi>Module</hi> of divine truth; given to the Church at firſt by Chriſt himſelf the <hi>great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and tranſmitted by the Miniſtry of thoſe who were ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively the <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> or <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.21.</note> from which no man is to recede upon pain of damnation.</p>
            <p>But now more <hi>particularly,</hi> we may obſerve, that beſides this great univerſal <hi>Map</hi> or <hi>Synopſis</hi> of divine truth; there are to be found in Scripture more <hi>compendious</hi> and <hi>ſummary abſtracts,</hi> and <hi>abridgements</hi> containing certain of the main <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>points</hi> of <hi>ſaving doctrine,</hi> methodized into leſſer <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>tables</hi> for the help of our faith and knowledge.</p>

               <hi>are a great help to memory.</hi> In all Arts and Sciences, <hi>order and method</hi> is of ſingular advantage unto <hi>memory.</hi> We do eaſily retain things in our mind, when we have once digeſted them into order; It is not ſo much <hi>multitude</hi> of objects, as their <hi>variouſneſse</hi> and <hi>independency</hi> which is burdenſome to memory; when once the underſtanding apprehends them in their <hi>natural</hi> union and fellowſhip one upon another, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory comprehends them with much more ſweetneſſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that <hi>NUMBER</hi> and <hi>PLACE</hi> are of ſuch rare uſe in the <hi>art of memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why people (generally) remember no more of the <hi>Sermons</hi> they hear, is for want of <hi>Catechizing,</hi> whereby they might come to know the principles of Religion in their <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>methodical contexture.</hi> Uſually in Sermons, truths are delivered ſingle and apart; and the ignorant hearer knows not where the Miniſter is, nor what place the doctrine delivered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the body of divinity, nor how they are knit together; and ſo the memory leaks them out as faſt as they are dropt in; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is the very <hi>glue</hi> of memory. Method in a ſingle Sermon, when the hearer is acquainted with it, gratifieth the <hi>memory,</hi> as well as the <hi>underſtanding;</hi> while it doth not only <hi>lodge</hi> things in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119240:16"/> their <hi>own place,</hi> but <hi>locks</hi> the <hi>door</hi> upon them, that they may not be loſt. When things are knit and linckt in one with another (as in a chaine) pull up one link, and that will pull up another, ſo that the whole chaine is preſerved. But we may have occaſion to ſpeak again of this point; And therefore,</p>

               <note place="margin">4. Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en affection.</note> 
               <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> have a notable influence upon the affections. The ſounding of a <hi>ſingle ſtring</hi> makes but little muſick; let a skilfull hand touch them in their muſical conſent and ſymphonie, and it affects the hearer to a kinde of raviſhment; So it is with <hi>evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical truths:</hi> place them in their proper rooms, that a man may behold them in their mutual correſpondencies, and apt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plings together, and truly, the <hi>Seraphims</hi> themſelves anſwering one to another, and ecchoing to another, make not a ſweeter har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in their <hi>celeſtial Hallelujahs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is a marvelous <hi>Antidote againſt errour and ſeduction.</hi> Goſpel truths in their <hi>ſeries</hi> and <hi>dependance,</hi> are a <hi>chain of gold</hi> to tie the <hi>truth</hi> and the <hi>ſoul</hi> cloſe together. People would not be ſo eaſily <hi>trapand into hereſie,</hi> if they were acquainted with the <hi>concatenation</hi> of Goſpel-doctrines within themſelves.</p>
            <p>As for inſtance, men would not certainly be ſo eaſily comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to worſhip that Idol of <hi>free-will,</hi> and the <hi>power of nature,</hi> were they well <hi>principled</hi> in the doctrine of the <hi>fall;</hi> The <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> of God in <hi>permitting</hi> of it, held out in Scripture in ſuch large and legible Characters, <hi>that he which runs may read,</hi> Pſal. 51.4. 1 Cor. 1.29, 30, 31, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Firſt, An aſſent to his being is abſolutely neceſſary, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe acts of worſhip are as a Ball ſtruck into the open air, which returns not to us; without the entire aſſurance of a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate object, Religion will fail and vaniſh, this belief is general and ſpeculative.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An aſſent to his bounty, that he will bleſſe thoſe <hi>who diligently ſeek him;</hi> this is particular and applicative, and it follows from the other; for the notion of a Benefactour is included in that of a God; take away his rewards, you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god him: Now the ſtedfaſt acknowledgement of this, can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw the ſoul to perform ingenuous and acceptable ſervice; for the naked contemplation of thoſe amiable excellencies which are in the Deity, can never conquer our natural feare, nor quench our enmity againſt him; the reflection upon his righteouſneſſe and our guilt, fills us with terrour, and cauſes a dreadful flight from him; but the hope of his remunerating goodneſſe, is a motive agreeable, and congruous to the breſt of a man, and ſweetly leads him to God; Religion is the ſubmiſſion of our ſelves to God, with an expectation of reward.</p>
            <p>I ſhall Treat of the firſt Branch of the argument; <hi>He that comes to God, muſt believe that he is.</hi> The firm belief of Gods being, is the foundation of all Religious worſhip; in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuſſing of which, my deſign is to evince that Supreme Truth, <hi>that God is.</hi> The ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h, by an appeal to nature, and Scriptures: I ſhall produce three Arguments from nature, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince an Infidel there is a God. The firſt is drawn from the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119240:22"/> viſible world. The ſecond from natural conſcience. The third from the conſent of Nations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the Creation; his eſſence and Attributes are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed, his abſolute power, unerring wiſdome, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſſe, are diſcovered to every capacity; therefore the Apoſtle urges this as the moſt proper Argument to convince the Heathens, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.15. <hi>that they ſhould urn from their vanities, to the living God which made heaven and earth, and ſea, and all things that are therein;</hi> to this they muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſſent; as ſhadows repreſent the figure of thoſe bodyes from whence they are derived; ſo in the world there are ſuch traces of the Divine perfections, that it is eaſie to inferre there is a Soveraign being which is the cauſe of it; all the creatures and their various excellencies, are as ſo many beams which reflect upon this Sun, or lines which direct to this Centre; nay, the meaneſt being carries ſome impreſſion of the firſt cauſe, as the image of a Prince is ſtampt upon a penny, as well as upon grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mony; the beaſts will inſtruct, and the mute fiſhes teach the Atheiſt there is a God; and though he is not diſcerned by the outward ſight, yet the underſtanding will as certainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, as it doth an inviſible ſpirit in a living body; and that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the being of the world, and its parts; it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to ſenſe, and acknowledged by all, that ſome things are of a late beginning, but thoſe things could not proceed from themſelves, for then they ſhould work before they were, and the ſame things ſhould exiſt, and not exiſt at the ſame inſtant, and in the ſame reſpect, but this implies a contradiction; it follows then they had their Original from without; we finde the experience of this in our ſelves; the number of our dayes declares there was a time in which we had no being, and therefore we could not produce our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Now, if man which is the moſt perfect of viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, preſuppoſe a Maker, then may we ſufficiently inferre a Creation, where we finde far leſſe perfection; and this is true, not only of things which are viſible, but of all other beings; till at laſt we arrive at the Supreme cauſe, whoſe being is neceſſary and independent.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:119240:23"/>
            <p>Beſides, if we conſider that from nothing he hath produced their beings, and ſo united thoſe two diſtant extreams of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not being, we may infer his power to be infinite; the greateſt difference imaginable between two finite beings, admits of ſome proportion, and meaſure; but between that which is, and that which is not, the diſtance exceeds all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; ſo that from the meer exiſtence of things, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that there is a firſt cauſe, which is independent and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and this is God.</p>

            <p>Let us now conſider that vaſt extent of aire, which fills the ſpace between heaven and earth; this is of ſo pure a nature, that in a moment it tranſmits the influences of heaven to the lower world, this ſerves as an arſenal for thunders and lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whereby God ſummons the world to dread and reverence; this is a treaſury for the clouds, which diſſolving in gentle ſhowers, refreſh the earth, and call forth its ſeeds into flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and fruitfulneſſe; this fannes the earth with the wings of the winde, allaying thoſe intemperate heats which would be injurious to its inhabitants; this is the Region for the Birds, wherein they paſſe as ſo many ſelf-moving Engines praiſing the Creatour, this ſerves for the breath and life of man; from hence we may conclude the wiſdome of a God, who ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes the ſeveral Regions of the aire, as by them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey bleſſings for the neceſſities of man, and to ſend judgements for the awakening the ſecure to ſeek after God.</p>
            <p>Let us now deſcend to the Sea, and ſee how that informes us there is a God; 'tis a Truth evident to reaſon, that the proper place of the waters is next to the aire above the earth; for as it is of a middle nature between theſe two Elements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purer and lighter than the earth, but more groſſe and heavy than the aire, ſo it challenges a ſituation between them; that as the aire on all parts encompaſſes the Sea, in like manner the Sea ſhould overſpread the earth, and cover the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of it; that its natural inclination is ſuch, appears by its continual flowings; who then hath arreſted its courſe, and ſtopt its violence? who hath confined it to ſuch a place and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, that it may not be deſtructive to the world? certainly no other, but the great God who firſt gave it being and motion; beſides, that which renders the power of God more conſpicuous, is that by ſo weak a bridle as the ſand, its rage is bounded; when it threatens the ſhore with its inſulting waves, you would fear leſt it ſhould ſwallow up all, but it no ſooner touches the ſand, but its fury is turned into froth; it retires, and by a kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, reſpects thoſe bounds which are fixt by the Creatour.

            <p n="3">3. We may argue there is a God from the operations of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agents for thoſe ends which are not perceived by them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in men there is a rational principle which diſcovers the goodneſſe of the end, and ſelects ſuch means as are proper for the accompliſhing of it, and ſo their actions are the product of their judgement; yet 'tis impoſſible to conceive that the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our rank of creatures, whoſe motions flow from meer inſtinct, can guide themſelves by any Counſel of their own: Now all their operations are directed to their proper ends without any variation,<note place="margin">Si quid est quod efficiat ea quae homo licet ratione ſit praeditus, facere non poſſet, id profecto est majus, &amp; ſortius, &amp; ſapientus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. <hi>Chryſippus.</hi>
               </note> &amp; in that order as exceeds the invention of man. It is admirable to conſider how brute creatures act for their preſervation; they are no ſooner in the world, but they preſently flie from their enemies, and make uſe either of that force or craft which they have to defend themſelves; they know that nouriſhment which is convenient to preſerve them, and thoſe remedies which may reſtore them. By what Counſel doth the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low obſerve the ſeaſon of its paſſage? in the beginning of Autumn it takes its flight to a warmer Climate, and returns with the Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the Spring. By what fore-ſight doth the Ant prepare its ſtore in Summer to prevent that enſuing want which otherwiſe it would ſuffer in Winter? Doth the Sun deliberate whether it ſhall riſe, and by diffuſing its beams, become the publick light of the World? or doth a Fountain adviſe whether it ſhall ſtream forth in a fluent and liberal manner? even the actions of men which are purely natural, are done without their direction: Nay, natural bodies will part with their own property, and croſſe their own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for an univerſal good; the aire, a light and nimble body that does naturally aſcend, yet for a general good, to prevent a breach in nature, it will deſcend: And thoſe things which have a natural oppoſition,<note place="margin">

If we ſee an Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſeveral Nations, (between whom there are great antipathies) yet march in rank and order, and with equal courage fight for the ſafety of a Kingdom,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119240:26"/> we preſently conclude there is a wiſe General who thus united them: And is there not greater reaſon to believe that a Soveraign Spirit governs the Hoſt of heaven and earth, and unites them to maintain the peace of the World? To aſſert that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational creatures act for a general and unknown good, without the motion of a higher cauſe, is equally unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as to ſay a curious Picture is drawn by a Penſil without the hand of the Painter which guided it in every line according to the Idea of his minde. We muſt then of neceſſity infer that thoſe particular cauſes which cannot conduct themſelves, are directed by an univerſal cauſe which cannot erre; and thus we ſee the whole World is an entire and continual Argument of Gods Being and Attributes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond Argument is drawn from natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is a ſubordinate God, and acts all things with reſpect to a higher Tribunal; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe viſible Teſtimonies which God hath expreſt to men in the Creation, ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>that he left not himſelf without a witneſſe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them rain, and fruitful ſeaſons;</hi> by the ſame proportion we may ſay God hath not left himſelf without an internal witneſſe, having planted in every man a conſcience whereby he is dignified above the lower order of beings, and made ſenſible of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge, to whoſe Tribunal he is ſubject; now conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in its double work, as it accuſes or excuſes by turns upon good or bad Actions, proves there is a God.</p>

It ſtings with remorſe for thoſe ſins which are above the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of man to revenge; thoſe who command Armies, and by their greatneſſe are ſecured from the penalties of the Law, yet conſcience ſets their ſins in order before their eyes; and theſe as ſo many armed men charge them thorow, and overwhelme them; many inſtances there are; <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> in the midſt of his cups and bravery, how was he invaded by fear and horrour, when <hi>he ſaw the hand-writing on the Wall!</hi> the whole Army of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians could not diſcourage his ſpirit; but when conſcience revived his guilt, and the apprehenſions of Gods juſtice, he ſunk under the burden; the hand-writing from without was terrible, becauſe conſcience opened a hand-writing within. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who was doubly dy'd in unnatural luſts and cruelties, could neither evade nor diſſemble the horrors of his mind; <hi>Nero</hi> after the barbarous murdering of his mother, was always purſued by imaginary Divels, his diſtracted fancy repreſenting to him furies and flames ready to torment him. How many Tyrants have trembled on the Throne, when the condemned innocents have rejoyced in their ſufferings! from hence we may infallibly conclude the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the moſt powerful ſinner is under the feeling of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for if there were no puniſhments to be feared but thoſe the Magiſtrate inflicts in his own Dominions, why are Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates themſelves under terrors for their vitious actions! and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119240:28"/> thoſe who are not ſubject to any humane Tribunal, why do they with ſuch fury reflect upon themſelves for their crimes? certainly it proceeds from hence, that natural conſcience dreads the ſupreme Judge, ſeeing nothing is able to ſhelter them from his Tribunal, nor reſtrain his power when he will take vengeance on them.</p>
            <p>In vain doth the Atheiſt reply that theſe fears are the product of a common falſe opinion, which is conveyed by education, to wit that there is a God who is provoked by ſin; and that ignorance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes theſe terrors, as little children fear bug-bears in the dark; for 'tis certain,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That no Art or endeavour can totally free a ſinner from theſe terrors, whereas groundleſſe fears are preſently ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by reaſon; and this argues there is an inviolable principle in nature which reſpects a God. We know there is nothing more diſturbs the ſpirit than fear, and every perſon is an enemy to what torments him; hence the ſinner labours to conquer conſcience, that he may freely indulge himſelf in ſin; but this is impoſſible; for conſcience is ſo eſſential, that a ſoul cannot be a ſoul without it, and ſo inſeparable, that death it ſelf cannot divorce a man from it; <hi>perire nec ſine te nec tecum poteſt;</hi> it can neither dye with the ſinner, nor without him; 'tis true the workings of it are unequal; as the pulſe doth not always beat alike, but ſometimes more violent, and ſometimes more remiſſe; ſo this ſpiritual pulſe is not always in equal motion; ſometimes it beats, ſometimes it intermits, but returns again; thoſe ſcorners who run a courſe of ſin without controule, and ſeem to deſpiſe hell, as a meer noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet they are not free from inward gripes; conſcience arreſts them in the Name of that God whom they deny; although they are without faith, they are not without fear; deſperate ſinners ruffle it for a time, and drench themſelves in ſenſual pleaſures, to quench that <hi>ſcintilla animae,</hi> that vital ſpark which ſhines and ſcorches at once; but all in vain; for it happens to them as to Malefactors, who for a time drown the apprehenſion of their danger in a Sea of drink; but when the fumes are evaporated, and they ſeriouſly ponder their offences, they tremble in the fearful expectation of the Axe or Gallows. A ſinner may conceal his fears from others, and appear jolly and brave, when conſcience ſtings him with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret remorſe; as a Clock ſeems to be calme and ſtill to the eye;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119240:28"/> but 'tis full of ſecret motions within; under a merry countenance there may be a bleeding heart: To conclude, ſo far is a ſinner from being able to quench theſe terrors, that many times the more they are oppoſed, the more powerful they grow; thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who for a time breathed nothing but defiances to conſcience, and committed ſin with greedineſſe, yet conſcience hath with ſuch fury returned upon them, that they have run from profaneſſe to ſuperſtition, as fugitive ſlaves are forc't back to their Maſters, and ſerve in the vileſt Drudgery, fearing ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The beſt men who enjoy a ſweet calmneſs, and are not diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted with the terrors of conſcience, they abhor that Doctrine which diſcards the fear of a Deity; ſo that thoſe who are moſt freed from theſe terrors, believe them to be radicated in nature, and grounded upon truth; and thoſe who eſteem them vain, are moſt furiouſly tormented with them; in which reſpect the Divine goodneſſe ſhines forth in the greateſt luſtre towards thoſe who love and fear him, and his juſtice againſt thoſe who contemn it; thus <hi>Caligula</hi> who was the boldeſt Atheiſt in the world, yet when it thundred, ran with trembling under his bed, as if God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had ſummoned him to judgement; whereas <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was the Heathens Martyr, died with the ſame tranquility of ſpirit wherein he lived.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis worthy of our ſerious thoughts that theſe terrors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are moſt dreadful when the ſinner approaches death; the ſenſe of guilt which before was ſmothered, is then revived; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience like a ſleeping Lyon awakes and deſtroys at once; experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lls us many ſinners who have lived in a ſenceleſſe, dye in a deſperate manner; and from whence doth this proceed but from the preſages of a future judgement! conſcience antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates the vengeance of God; then the Alarums are encreaſt, and the ſtorme is more violent; for the ſoul being ſenſible of its immortal nature, extends its fears to Eternity, and trembles at him who lives for ever, and can puniſh for ever.</p>

               <hi>Argument</hi> 3. The conſent of Nations agrees in the belief of a God; although the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did groſſely miſtake the life and eſſence of the infinite Deity, imagining him to be of ſome humane forme and weakneſſe, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect were without God in the world; yet they conſpired in the acknowledgement of a Divinity; the multiplicity of their falſe gods ſtrengthens the Argument; it being clear they would rather have any God then none; and this belief cannot be an impoſture, becauſe 'tis</p>
            <p>Firſt, Univerſal; What Nation ſo barbarous as not to worſhip a God? certainly that which is common to all men, hath a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, 'tis perpetual; falſhoods are not long lived; but the Character and Impreſſion of God is indelibly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the ſpirits of men. Thus we ſee the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Reaſon of the World to Determine there is a God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture proves there is a God to faith; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the double manifeſtation of God by his Works and his Word, appropriates a converting power to the Word; this exceeds the diſcovery of God in the Creation, in reſpect of its clearneſſe and efficacy: <hi>Pſalme</hi> 138.2. <hi>Thou hast magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</hi> There are more apparent Characters of Gods Attributes and Perfections in the Scripture, than in the Book of Nature; in the Creation there is <hi>

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> have rendred ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction concerning this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> So good men were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſt with troubles, when the wicked were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, and this ſhook his faith; but by <hi>entring into the Sanctuary of God,</hi> where he underſtood their end, he comes off with victory; now for the removing this Objection, Conſider</p>
            <p>Firſt, we are not competent Judges of Gods actions; we ſee but one half of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion; the Wheels, but not the eye in the Wheels; nothing but the Wheels on which the world ſeems diſorderly to run, not the eye of Providence which governs them in their moſt vertiginous changes: The actions of God do not want clearneſſe, but clearing: What we cannot acquit, is not to be charged on God as unjuſt; the ſtick which is ſtreight, being in the water ſeems croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, by the refraction of the beams through a double <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> we ſee through fleſh and ſpirit, and cannot diſtinctly judge the ways of God; but when we are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the particular reaſons of his diſpenſations, yet we muſt conclude his judgements to be right, as will appear by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſufferings of the righteous do not blemiſh Gods juſtice.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:119240:30"/>1. God always ſtrikes an offender, every man being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in reſpect of his Law. Now though love cannot hate, yet it may be angry; and upon this account, where <hi>the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are a great deep,</hi> unfathomable by any finite underſtanding, <hi>yet his righteouſneſſe ſtandeth like the high Mountains,</hi> (as it is in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 36.) viſible to every eye; if the moſt righteous perſon ſhall look inward, and weigh his own carriage and deſert, he muſt neceſſarily glorifie the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and holineſſe of God in all his proceedings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The afflictions of good men are ſo far from ſtaining Gods juſtice, that they manifeſt his mercy; for the leaſt ſin being a greater evil than the greateſt affliction; God uſes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral croſſes to prevent or deſtroy ſin; he imbitters their lives to wean their affections from the World, and to create in them ſtrong deſires after heaven; as long as the waters of tribulation are on the earth, ſo long they dwell in the Ark; but when the Land is dry, even the Dove it ſelf will be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and defile its ſelf: When they are afflicted in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, it is that the inward man may be revived; as birds are brought to perfection by the ruines of the ſhell: that is not a real evil which God uſes as an inſtrument to ſave us. Who will eſteem that Phyſitian unjuſt, who prevents the death of his Patient by giving a bitter potion?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the Righteous be thus afflicted upon earth, we may conclude there is a reward in the next World; if they are thus ſharply treated in the way, their Countrey is above, where God is their portion and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The temporary proſperity of the wicked reflects no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon Gods juſtice or holineſſe; for God meaſures all things by the Standard of eternity; a thouſand years to him are as one day. Now we do not charge a Judge with unrighteouſneſſe, if he defer the execution of a Malefactor for the day; the longeſt life of a ſinner bears not that proportion to eternity; beſides, their reprieve increaſes and ſecures their ruine; they are as Grapes which hang in the Sun till they are ripe, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119240:30"/> fit for the Wine-preſſe. God ſpares them now, but will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for ever; he condemns them to proſperity in this world, and judges them not worth his anger, intending to poure forth the vials of his wrath on them in the next.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The more ſober Heathens have concluded from hence there is a judgement to come; becauſe otherwiſe the beſt would be moſt miſerable, and the ungodly proſperous; from hence they have inferred, that becauſe all things are diſpenc't in a promiſcuous manner to the juſt and unjuſt in this world, therefore there muſt be an after-reckoning.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There are many viſible examples of the goodneſſe and juſtice of God in this World; either in rewarding afflicted innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or puniſhing proſperous iniquities. He that ſhall read the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and conſider that wonderful chain of cauſes managed by the Divine Providence; how God made uſe of the treachery of his brethren, not as a ſale, but a conveyance; how by the Priſon he came to the principality, muſt conclude there is a watchful eye which orders all things: And how many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are there of Gods ſevere, and impartial juſtice? there is no State or Hiſtory but preſents ſome examples; wherein an exact proportion in the time, meaſure and kind between the ſin and puniſhment, is moſt conſpicuous; the unnatural ſin of <hi>Sodom</hi> was puniſh't with a ſupernatural ſhowre of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had made the River guilty of the blood of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Infants; his firſt plague is the turning of the River into blood; <hi>Adonibezec</hi> is juſt ſo ſerved as he did by the ſeventy Kings; <hi>Judas</hi> who wanted bowels for his Lord, wanted bowels for himſelf in life and death; for he hanged himſelf, and his bowels guſhed out; and thus the puniſhment as a hand, points at the ſin, and convinces the World of a Deity.</p>

            <p>Firſt, To thoſe who are practical Atheiſts <hi>vita,</hi> in life, who live down this truth, denying God in their lives; ſad and certain it is, that many who pretend they know God, yet ſo live they, as if there were no Deity to whom they muſt give an account: Such are the ſecure, that ſleep in ſin, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Gods thunder; and if ever ſleep were the true image of death, this is the ſleep. The ſenſual who are ſo loſt in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſures, they ſcarce remember whether they have a ſoul; if at any time conſcience begins to murmure, they relieve their melancholy thoughts with their company and cups, like <hi>Saul,</hi> ſending for the Muſick when the evil ſpirit was upon him. The incorrigible, who notwithſtanding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of Gods mercy to reduce them; although Providences, Ordinances conſpire to bring them off from their evil ways; yet they perſiſt in their diſobedience: Let ſuch conſider it is not a looſe and ineffective aſſent to the being and perfections of God which will ſave them; God is not glorified by an unactive faith; nay, this will put the moſt dreadful accent, and the moſt killing aggravations on their ſins; that believing there is a God, they dare preſumptuouſly offend him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Almighty to jealouſie, as if they were able either to evade, or to ſuſtain his wrath; 'tis the greateſt prodigy in the World to believe there is a God, and yet to diſobey him; this renders them inexcuſable at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To thoſe who are Atheiſts <hi>voto,</hi> in deſire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God;</hi> the heart is the Fountain of deſires, he wiſhes there were no God; this Atiſhem ſprings from the former; men live as if there were no God, and then wiſh there were none; guilt always begets fear, and fear hatred; and that ſtrikes at the being of the object that is hated; as Malefactors deſire there were no Law nor Judge, that they might eſcape deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Well their deſires are as viſible to God as their actions are to men, and in the day of Revelation there will be a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wrath anſwerable to the Wickedneſſe of their hearts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To thoſe who are Atheiſts <hi>judicio,</hi> in opinion; theſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119240:31"/> low running dregs of time afford us many of theſe Monſters; for many to reconcile their principles with their practices, that they may undiſturbedly enjoy their luſts, take this as an Opiate potion, that there is no God; but this is the moſt irrational and impious blaſphemy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Irrational; for the Name of God is written in ſo fair a Character upon this univerſal frame, that even whil'ſt men run they may read it; and therefore God never wrought a miracle to convince Atheiſme, becauſe his ordinary works convince it: Moreover, the notion of a Deity is ſo deeply impreſt on the Tables of all mens hearts, that to deny God, is to kill the ſoul in the eye, to quench the very principles of common nature, to leave never a vital ſpark or ſeed of humanity behinde; 'tis as if an ungracious ſoul ſhould deny he ever had a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He that does ungod God, does unman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis the moſt impious; 'tis formally <hi>Deicidium,</hi> a killing of God as much as in them lies; but there are no Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in hell, the Divels believe and tremble; he that willingly quenches that light which is planted in his breaſt, he is paſſing from that voluntary darkneſſe to a worſe; like an offender on the Scaffold, he doth but blinde his eyes to have his head cut off; he goes from inward darkneſſe to utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

Let us ſtabliſh our hearts in the belief of Gods Being; in the latter times the World is wholly diſpoſed to Atheiſme; as the Scripture attributes the ruine of the Old World to their Atheiſme and Profaneſſe, ſo it foretells the univerſal diſeaſe of the laſt Age will be Atheiſme and Infidelity. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. <hi>Nevertheleſs when the Son of man cometh, ſhall he finde faith on the earth?</hi> it were impoſſible there ſhould be ſuch a palpable contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lives of men and this fundamental of Religion, did they with aſſurance and certainty believe it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God; they are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doth good.</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:119240:32"/> Atheiſme is the root of Profaneſſe; moreover, the ſpiritual myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion, which exceed the flight of reaſon, are oppoſed by many upon the account of their Atheiſme; they queſtion the truth of Gods Being, and therefore disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſupernatural Revelations; let us then treaſure up this truth:</p>
            <p>Firſt, As the foundation of faith; for all the truths of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpring from this as their common principle; the watering of the root will cauſe the branches to flouriſh; ſo the confirming of this will render our aſſent to the doctrine of the Goſpel more clear and ſtrong.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the fountain of obedience; the true and ſound belief of every holy truth always includes a correſpondency in the believer to the thing believed; and this muſt deſcend from the underſtanding to the affections, and the converſation: Now the fundamental duties which we are to pay to God, are, love, fear, dependance and ſubmiſſion to the will of his Law, and of his Providence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Love: He is the ſupreme object of love for his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and benefits. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Let them alſo that love thy Name rejoyce in thee;</hi> the Name of God imports thoſe glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes whereby he hath expreſt himſelf to us; all the excellencies of the creature meet eminently in him, and all their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are removed; in him there is nothing unlovely; in worldly things how refined ſoever they be, there is an allay of dregs; the all that is in them is mixed with corruption; but in God the all that he is, is perfection; in the moſt glorious creature as a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there is <hi>aliquid nihili,</hi> ſome imperfection, it is not exactly fitted for the ſoul; but God is the Adequate and compleat object of our love. There is ſuch an infinite eminency in God, that we are obliged to a proportionable affection; the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.36. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſtrength;</hi> all the kinds and degrees of our love are due to him; we muſt put no bounds nor limits to it; in him it muſt begin, in him it muſt end;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119240:32"/> a remiſſer love is a degree of hatred; we diſparage his excellencies by the coldneſſe of our affections. O had we but eyes to ſee his beauty, how would all the excellencies of the creatures become a very Glow-worme that only glitters in the night!</p>
            <p>Moreover, God planted this affection in the nature of man, that it might be terminated upon himſelf as its centre and treaſure, as our natural faculties are fitted for their ſeveral objects; the eye for colours, the ear for ſounds, the palate for taſts; ſo love is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for God, that being as the Soveraign which ſways all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Love is called <hi>pondus animae,</hi> that ſets all the wheels in the clock of the ſoul a going; this ſets the underſtanding a work in the ſerious contemplation of the Divine excellencies; it diverts the thoughts from other things, and fixes them on God; it excites ſtrong deſires, and earneſt aſpirings after him; it ſtirs up zeal, which is <hi>flamma amoris,</hi> love in a flame to remove all obſtacles which hinder the moſt intimate union with him; it produces joy, when the ſoul repoſes its ſelf in God, and with infinite ſweetneſs poſſeſſes him; it cauſes the greateſt diligence, alacrity, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in all our ways to pleaſe him: for love is ever the ſpring and rule of all our actions; ſuch as it is, ſuch likewiſe will they be: thus we may ſee that God (as there is in him a union of all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies) challenges the moſt intenſe and vehement degree of our love, he being only fitted for it; and that our love being a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative affection, is only proper to God; and therefore to love any creature without God, or in an equal manner to him, is to Deify the creature, to place it in the room of God, and ſo it renders us guilty of Idolatry in a ſpiritual ſenſe. But ſuch is the ignorance of mens minds, and the depravedneſſe of their wills, that few there be who love God; 'tis true, there may be ſomething like love in natural men to God, grounded upon the perſwaſion of his glorious being, and the goodneſſe of his nature, which is not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them; but when they conſider his mercy is a holy mercy, and that it is never diſpenc't to the prejudice of his juſtice, though they cannot hate God for his goodneſſe directly, yet they hate him with it; for although he is the perfection of beauty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelf, yet they being evil, there is no congruity or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency between God and them; they love ſin, and hate puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119240:33"/> Now God, as <hi>Author legis,</hi> by the moſt ſtrict Laws for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids ſin, and as <hi>ultor peccati,</hi> inflicts ſevere puniſhments; from hence it proceeds, the moſt lovely and ſweet Attributes of God cannot endear him to them; no more than the natural or moral excellencies of a Judge, the comelineſſe of his perſon, or his wiſdome and knowledge can draw forth the love of a Malefactor when he is condemned by him.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſince the general nature of ſin is an eternal contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to the nature and will of God; the love of it muſt needs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the hatred of God; for as the Lord Jeſus requires an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, chearful and conſtant obedience, as the moſt clear evidence of love to him; <hi>if you love me, keep my Commandments;</hi> So the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be as ſtrong to conclude backward, If you keep not Gods Commandments, you hate him; to live in the practice of known ſinnes, is a vertual and interpretative hatred of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The benefits which God beſtows upon us deſerve our love. How great an endearment did he paſſe upon us in our Creation? we might have been admitted into the loweſt form of Creatures, and have only enjoyed the life of flies or worms; but <hi>he made us little lower than the Angels, and Crowned us with glory and honour, and gave us dominion over all the works of his hands,</hi> Pſal. 8.5. Whereas the reſt of the Creatures were the acts of his power; the Creation of man was an act of power and wiſdome; in all the reſt there was nothing, but <hi>he ſpake the word, and they were made,</hi> Pſal. 148.5. But in the making of man there was a conſultation about it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Let us make man;</hi> he framed our bodies, ſo that all the parts conſpire for the ornament and ſervice of the whole: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.15. <hi>Thine eye did ſee my ſubstance being yet imperfect, and in thy book were all my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers written;</hi> and therefore <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaid truly, <hi>hominem non patrem eſſe ſed generandi Ministrum;</hi> man is only the inſtrument which the Lord doth uſe for the effecting of his purpoſe to raiſe the beautiful Fabrick of mans body: Now if we are obliged to expreſſe the deareſt love to our Parents, with how much greater reaſon ſhould we love God, who is the fountain of all our beings.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:119240:33"/>
            <p>He hath breathed into man a ſpiritual, immortal, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul, which is more worth than the whole World; this is in ſome ſort a ſpark and ray of Divine brightneſſe; 'tis capable of Gods Image, 'tis a fit Companion for Angels, to joyne with them in the praiſes of God, and enjoy a bleſſed eternity with them. 'Tis capable of communion with God himſelf, who is the fountain of life and happineſſe. The ſoul is endowed with thoſe faculties which being terminated upon God, it enjoys an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and everlaſting bleſſedneſſe. The underſtanding by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge reſts in God as the firſt and higheſt <hi>in genere veri;</hi> the will by love embraces him as the laſt and greateſt <hi>in genere boni;</hi> and ſo receives perfection and ſatisfaction, which is the incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable priviledge of the rational ſoul. Beaſts can only converſe with droſſy and material objects, they are confined to earthly things; but the ſoul of man may enjoy the poſſeſſion and fruition of God, who is the Supreme and Soveraign good. Now this ſhould inflame our love to God; he formed our bodies, he inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our ſouls. Moreover, if we conſider our lives, we ſhall finde a chain of mercy which reaches from one end to the other of them.</p>
            <p>How many Miracles of Providence do we enjoy in our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? how many unſeen dangers do we eſcape? how great are our daily ſupplies? The proviſions we receive, do ſerve not only for neceſſity, but for delight; every day we have the proviſions of meat and drink not only to cure hunger, and all our thirſt, but to refreſh the heart, and to make us chearful in our work; every houre is filled up with the bounties of God: Now what ſhall we render to the Lord for all his benefits? he deſires our love; this is the moſt proper return we can make; for love is of an opening and expanſive quality calling forth the heart; our love within ſhould break forth to cloſe with Gods love without; the love of obedience in us, with the love of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and bounty in him. 'Tis a principle of nature deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the hearts of men, to return love for love; nay, the very Beaſts are not deficient in this; <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.3. <hi>The Oxe knows his Owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters Crib:</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:119240:34"/> Thoſe Creatures which are of all the moſt ſtupid and heavy, reſpect their Feeders, and expreſſe dumb ſigns of love unto them. How much more ſhould we love God, who ſpreads our Table, fills our Cup, and cauſes his Sun to ſhine, and his Rain to fall on us? 'Tis an Argument of Secret Atheiſme in the heart, that in the confluence of mercies we enjoy, we do not look up to the Author of them, as if common mercies were the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Chance, and not of Providence; if a man conſtantly relieves our wants, we judge it the moſt barbarous diſingenuity not to repay love to him; but God loads us with his benefits every day; his wiſdome is always buſied to ſerve his mercy, and his mercy to ſerve our neceſſities, but we are inſenſible and unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet the meaneſt mercy as it comes from God hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſtamp't upon it. We ſhould upbraid our ſouls for our coldneſſe to God; everywhere we encounter ſenſible demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his love to us; in every moment of our lives we have ſome pledges of his goodneſſe. Let us light our Torch at this Mountain of fire; let the renewed act of his bounty conſtrain us to love him; we ſhould love him for his excellency, though we had no benefit by him; nay, though he hated us, we are bound to love him as he is truly amiable in himſelf; how much more when he draws us with the cords of a man, with bands of love? whoſoever requites the love of God with hatred, (as every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner doth) puts off the nature of man, and degenerates into a Divel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Fear;</hi> this is that eternal reſpect which is due to our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; an humble reverence we owe to him, as he is infinitely above us; the holy Angels cover their faces when they have the cleareſt views of his glory: <hi>Eſay</hi> 6.1, 2, 3.. <hi>The Lord is repreſented as ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a Throne, and the Seraphims ſtood about, each having ſix wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain his feet, and with twain did he flee; and one cryed to another, Holy, holy, holy Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory:</hi> The Angels are pure and innocent Creatures; they <hi>fear</hi> not his angry juſtice, but they adore his excellencies and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; his is a dread, when a moſt Serene Majeſty. Penal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119240:34"/> 
               <hi>fear</hi> is inconſiſtent with the joys of heaven, but the fear of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration is perfected there; and in this ſenſe the <hi>fear of God continues for ever,</hi> Pſal. 19.9. In all our addreſſes to him we ſhould compoſe our ſpirits, by the awful apprehenſion of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance which is between God and us. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; for God is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thou upon earth;</hi> the greateſt diſtance in nature is but an imperfect diſcovery how much we are beneath God; 'tis the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of grace to repreſent the Divine being and glory ſo to the ſoul, that in the moſt ſocial duties it may have impreſſions of <hi>fear;</hi> Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> We ſhould <hi>fear</hi> his greatneſſe and power, in whoſe hands our life and breath, and all our wayes are; the <hi>fear of God</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its actual force upon the ſoul, is operative and inſtrumental to holy walking, from whence the <hi>fear of God</hi> is taken in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the whole duty of man, it being an introduction to it. <hi>The fear of God, and keeping his Commandments</hi> are joined together, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. This is the <hi>Prepoſitus</hi> which governs our actions according to Gods will; this is a watchful Centinel againſt the moſt pleaſant temptations; it kills delight in ſin, (by which the integrity of moſt men is loſt;) for delight cannot dwell with <hi>fear;</hi> this is the guard and ſecurity of the ſoul in the days of trouble; the <hi>fear of God</hi> countermines the <hi>fear</hi> of men; this cuts off baſe and unworthy complyings; therefore the Lord brings this as an antidote againſt the baſe <hi>fear</hi> of men; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13. <hi>Who art thou, that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and of the ſon of man, that ſhall be made as graſs? And forgetteſt the Lord thy Maker, that ſtretcheth forth the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the Earth?</hi> This exalts a Chriſtian above humane frailty, and makes him deſpiſe the threatnings of the world, whereby many are terrified from their conſtancy. It is the moſt unreaſonable thing to be Cowards to men, and <hi>fearleſs of God.</hi> Men have but a finite power, and ſo they cannot do that hurt they would; and they are under the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, and therefore are diſabled from doing that hurt, which otherwiſe they could do; but the power of God is abſolute and unconfined; therefore our Saviour preſſes with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency upon his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Fear not them which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119240:35"/> kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul; but rather fear him who is able to deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell:</hi> He lives for ever, and can puniſh for ever; therefore when duty and life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together, he that flies the danger by delivering up his ſoul, exchanges the pain of a moment for the torments of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:<note place="margin">Timent Carcerem, non ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Gehennam; timent Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatum Temporalem, non poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas ignis aeterni; timent modicum mori, non aeternum mori.</note> 
               <hi>Auſtin</hi> upbraids the folly of ſuch; <hi>They fear the Priſon, but they fear not Hell; they fear temporal torment, but they fear not the pains of unquenchable fire; they fear the firſt, but not the ſecond death.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Dependance,</hi> in reſpect of his al-ſufficiency to ſupply our wants; and Omnipotency to ſecure us from dangers</p>
            <p>Firſt, his al-ſufficiency can ſupply our wants; he is the Sun, Fountain and Mine of all that is good; from hence the Prophet glories in God, <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines; the labour of the Olives ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat; the Flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls; yet I will r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>joyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> He expreſſes not only things for delight, as the <hi>fruit of the Vine and fig-tree,</hi> but things for neceſſity, as <hi>the meat of the field,</hi> and <hi>the flocks of the ſtall,</hi> and the utter failing of theſe together; for otherwiſe the want of one might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the enjoyment of another. Now in the abſolute loſſe of theſe ſupports and comforts of life, the Prophet ſaw all things in God; want of all outward things is infinitely recompenc't in the preſence of God: The Sun needs not the glimmering light of the Stars to make day; God without the aſſiſtance of the Creatures can make us really happy; in the enjoying of him we have all things, and that to the greateſt advantage. The things of this world deceive our expectations, and draw forth our corruptions; but in God we enjoy them more refinedly, and more ſatisfyingly, the dregs of ſin and ſorrow being removed; by poſſeſſing God there is no burden which we are not able to bear, but he takes it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, our wants, weakneſſe and ſufferings; and there is no excellency of his which we are able to enjoy, but he conveys
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119240:35"/> to us, his grace, his glory. There is true riches in his favour, true honour in his approbation, true pleaſure in his peace. He is the treaſure and triumph of the ſoul. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoul, therefore will I hope in him:</hi> He is ſuch a <hi>portion,</hi> that all temporal croſſes cannot hinder its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on us, and his influxive preſence makes heaven; he is a <hi>portion</hi> that cannot be loſt, he inſeparably abides with the ſoul.</p>
            <p>The real belief and application of this will keep a Saint in an holy independency on earthly things;<note place="margin">Cum mundus exarſerit, cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat ſe nihil habere de tanta mole perden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> the flames which ſhall burn the World, cannot touch his <hi>portion;</hi> he may ſtand upon its ruines, and ſay, <hi>I have loſt nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, this will keep the ſoul upright in the courſe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for all the exorbitancies and ſwervings from the Rule pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the apprehenſions of ſome particular good in the Creature, which draws men aſide. Thoſe who want the light of faith (which diſcovers Gods al-ſufficiency) only admire preſent and ſenſible things; and to obtain theſe, they depart from God; but the more eagerly they ſeek after theſe temporal good things, the further they run from the Fountain of goodneſſe, which alone can ſweeten the beſt things we enjoy; and counterbalance their abſence; the Creatures are but of a limited benignity, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of their number proves the meanneſs of their value; but one God anſwers all, he is an infinite and indefective good; he is for all the powers of ſoul and body, to hold them in their pleaſant exerciſe, and to give them reſt; he is alone able to impart happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to preſerve that happineſſe he imparts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his Omnipotency can ſecure us from dangers. The Creation is a ſtanding Monument of his Almighty Power; for what but Omnipotency could out of nothing produce the beautiful Fabrick of heaven and earth; man cannot work without mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, but God doth; and that which exalts his power, is, that he made it by his Word; <hi>he spake the Word, and they were made,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9. There went no greater pains to the Worlds Creation, than Gods command.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:119240:36"/>
            <p>Moreover, the World is preſerved from periſhing by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of its Maker. Certainly, without the ſupport of his mighty hand, the World had long before this time relapfed to its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nothing: Many inſtances we have of his power, in thoſe miraculous deliverances which he hath ſhewn to his people in their extremity; ſometimes by ſuſpenſion of the Works of Nature; <hi>his dividing the Red Sea,</hi> and <hi>making it as a ſolid Wall,</hi> that the <hi>Iſraelites might have a ſecure paſſage! his ſtopping the Sun in its courſe,</hi> that <hi>Joſhua might have time to deſtroy his enemies! his ſuſpending the nature of the fire,</hi> that it might not ſo much as <hi>ſinge the garments of the three Hebrews! his ſhutting the mouth of the devouring Lyons,</hi> and <hi>r turning Daniel in ſafety from that dreadful Den!</hi> And are not all theſe, and many others of this kind, not only the pregnant teſtimonies of his love, but the everlaſting Characters of his Omnipotency. Moreover, that which expreſſes the power of God with as great a luſtre, is the turning of the hearts of many cruel enemies from their intended rage to favour his people; thus did he change the heart of <hi>Eſau, who had reſolved the death of his brother;</hi> that inſtead of killing him, he expreſt the greateſt tenderneſſe, and the moſt endearing affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him; thus did he ſo ſway the hearts of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the oppreſſed <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that inſtead of <hi>ſecuring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bondage, they encouraged their departure, by enriching them with jewels of ſilver and of gold,</hi> Exod. 12.35. Now our duty is to glorifie this power of God, by placing our truſt on him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.2, 3. <hi>My help comes from the Lord, who made the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth;</hi> he will not ſuffer thy foot to be moved; by dependance on God the ſoul is compoſed in the midſt of the moſt apparent dangers; as the upper Region of the Aire is calme and ſerene, whatever ſtormes are here below; thus <hi>David</hi> expreſſes the ſame courage in all Eſtates; when he was retired into a Cave to ſhelter himſelf from the fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> he ſung the 57. <hi>Pſal.</hi> which he then compoſed; <hi>My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed,</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the fifth verſe of this Chapter, the Apoſtle had laid this down as an Article of faith, that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Sonne of God. <hi>Who is he that ovcrcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Sonne of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 5.5.</note> Now for the proof of ſo glorious a truth, the Apoſtle produces ſix witneſſes, and ranks them into two orders, ſome bear record in heaven, and ſome bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on earth; ſome bear witneſſe on earth, as <hi>ver.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> of this Chapter, <hi>There are three that bear witneſse on earth, the Spirit and the water, and the blood, and theſe three agree in one;</hi> and ſome bear record in heaven, in the words of my Text: <hi>There
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119240:38"/> are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words you may take notice of theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The number of the heavenly witneſſes, or the number of thoſe witneſſes that bear record in heaven, <hi>viz. three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Their dignity or excellency, they are <hi>in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Their act, they <hi>bear record.</hi>

               </label> 
               <hi>That it is not an eaſie matter to believe that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God:</hi> Whence is it elſe that the Apoſtle ſo often urges this point in this Epiſtle? whence is it elſe, that whereas it is ſufficient for any truth to be confirmed by the mouth of two or three witneſſes? here are no leſſe than ſix witneſſes produced to prove that the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is the Sonne of God; three heavenly, and three earthly; and indeed who can declare the great myſtery of the eternal generation of the Son of God: I will give five wonders in five words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God the Father communicates the whole divine eſsence unto the Sonne, and yet hath the whole divine eſſence in himſelf:</hi> If God communicates his eſſence, it muſt be his whole eſſence; for that which is infinite, cannot admit of any diviſion, partition, or diminution; yet methinks, we have a faint reſemblance of this here below. 'Tis not with things of a ſpiritual nature, as with things of a corporeal; ſpiritual things may be communicated without being leſſened or divided; <hi>viz.</hi> when I make a man know that which I know, my knowledge is ſtill the ſame, and nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; and upon his account, whether that Argument againſt the <hi>traduction</hi> of the ſoul, that if the ſoul of the Father be <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,</hi> the Father is left ſoul-leſſe be cogent, I leave to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learned: 'Tis to be granted, that to communicate the notion is one thing, and the faculty is another, but both are things of a ſpiritual nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God the Father, and God the Sonne are one eſſence, and yet though the Father begets the Sonne, the Sonne doth not beget himſelf:</hi> The Father and the Sonne are one God, yet the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is the Sonne of God, under that notion, as God is a Father,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119240:38"/> and not the Sonne of God, under the notion as God is a Sonne, and ſo not the Sonne of himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God the Father begetteth God the Sonne, and yet the Father is not elder than the Sonne, nor the Sonne younger than the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> he that begetteth, is not in time before him that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; if God was a Father from everlaſting, then Chriſt was a Sonne from everlaſting; for <hi>relata ſunt ſimul natura,</hi> an eternal Father muſt have an eternal Sonne.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Father begets the Sonne, yet the Sonne is not inferiour to the Father, nor the Father ſuperiour to the Sonne:</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt being in <hi>the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> it was his right, and therefore it was no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery; as he is coeternal, ſo he is coequal with the Father.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The Father begets the Sonne, yet the Sonne hath the ſame numerical nature with the Father, and the Father the ſame numerical nature with the Sonne;</hi> an earthly ſonne hath the ſame ſpecifical nature with his Father, but then though it be the ſame in regard of kinde, yet it differs in regard of number; but God the Father, and God the Sonne have the ſame individual numerical nature.</p>

               </label> Let me entreat you that you would attend unto the record and teſtimony that is given by thoſe witneſſes; and for your encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſider the difference between theſe heavenly witneſſes in the Text, and earthly wi neſſes, and ſo I ſhall proceed to that which I mainly intend.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On earth; there may be ſome ſingle or one witneſſe, but here are no leſſe than <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Earthly, witneſſes are ſuch as are lyable to exception, but theſe are <hi>in heaven</hi> beyond all exception.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for earthly witneſſes, it may come to paſſe that their names may not be known, theſe here are named; <hi>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Earthly witneſſes, when they are produced, either may be ſilent, or it may be bear falſe witneſſe, but theſe <hi>bear record,</hi> and their <hi>record</hi> is true.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Earthly witneſſes may not agree in their witneſſe, as the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes brought againſt Chriſt; but there is a ſweet conſent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement amongſt theſe witneſſes, for <hi>theſe three are one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:119240:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. Whereas Earthly witneſſes, although they may be one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of conſent, yet they are not one in regard of eſſence; every man hath one particular individual eſſence of his own, but theſe are one in regard of eſſence: Now pray mark this, for if it be ſo, then the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghoſt God. And therefore the <hi>Socinian,</hi> who denies the Deity of the Word, and of the Holy Ghoſt, will perſwade you to believe that theſe words are to be expounded thus, <hi>theſe three are one;</hi> that is, ſayes he, theſe three agree in one; but that this is not the meaning of the phraſe, appears by the variation of it in the next verſe; the words are,<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> 
               <hi>There are three that bear witneſſe on earth, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the water, and the blood, and theſe three agree in one:</hi> Now if both phraſes note unity in conſent, here is an occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and falling adminiſtred by the variation of them in theſe two verſes; why is it not ſaid the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt agree in one, as well as the Spirit, water and blood.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſe we ſhould grant that the oneneſſe ſpoken of in the Text is to be expounded of conſent in will and agreement, yet it would prove the Godhead both of the Father, and Spirit; for in free Agents, where there is the ſame will, there is the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, indeed with men it is the ſame ſpecifical nature, not nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical; becauſe there is but one God only, therefore here it muſt be the ſame numerical nature.</p>

               <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
               <hi>The doctrine</hi> I would ſpeak more fully to, is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or that <hi>there are three perſons in the divine eſſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this point, I ſhall (by Gods aſſiſtance) obſerve this method.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to the notion of a Divine perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew you that theſe are three perſons in the Divine eſſence.</p>

            <p n="5">5. I ſhall enquire whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her the myſtery of the Trinity may be found out by the light of nature.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Uſe and Application.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:119240:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to the notion of a divine perſon; what a divine perſon is, or wherein it conſiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſol.</hi> 1. <hi>Negatively;</hi> a divine perſon in the preciſe notion of it, is not a being or <hi>ſingularis ſubſtantia perſona, &amp; natura ſingularis clare diſtinguitur;</hi> there is a clear difference between perſon and nature, as you may perceive by theſe following conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> aſſumed the nature of man, and yet not the perſon of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe things which may really be ſeparated are not the ſame; but that perſonality may be ſeparated from nature, appears by the foregoing inſtance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If a perſon were a being, it muſt either be finite or infinite; if finite, then ſomething finite would be in God; if infinite, then there would be three infinites in God, or which is all one, there would be three Gods; now <hi>Deum trinum aſſerimus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um triplicem negamus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitively;</hi> a perſon is <hi>modus rei,</hi> the manner of a being; and a divine perſon is <hi>modus divinae eſſentiae,</hi> the divine eſſence modificated, or the divine eſſences conſidered three manner of wayes; for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtance, conſider the divine eſſence as the fountain or principle of deity, ſo it is the firſt perſon; conſider it as ſtreaming forth from the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her, ſo it is the ſecond perſon; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as breathed forth by Father and Son, and ſo it is the third perſon.</p>
            <p>I ſaid before that the Father is the fountain or principle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; now this muſt warily be underſtood; I do not ſay, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the cauſe of deity, but the principle; there is a wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>p incipium</hi> &amp; <hi>cauſam,</hi> a principle and a cauſe. <hi>Omnis cauſa eſt pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncipium, ſed omne principium non eſt cauſa;</hi> the cauſe of a thing may be called its beginning, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a thing is not neceſſarily its cauſe; the beginning of a line, is not the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>But to return, where we were, a divine perſon is <hi>modus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae eſſentiae,</hi> the divine eſſence modificated, the divine eſſence conſidered three manner of wayes; now the manner of a thing is neither <hi>ens,</hi> nor <hi>nihil;</hi> it is neither a thing, nor yet nothing; for inſtance, the folding of my hands, is not <hi>ens,</hi> for then I ſhould be a Creatour, and make ſomething; nor is it plainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119240:40"/> for there is difference between my hands folded, and my hands expanded.</p>
            <p>Now we uſe the word perſon, becauſe it notes the ſubſiſtence of the moſt excellent kind of being, and hath more in it than ſubſiſtence hath; we ſay a beaſt doth ſubſiſt, but it is abſurd to ſay a beaſt hath perſonality; becauſe a perſon notes an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſubſiſtent;<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> beſides, the word perſon is attributed to God in the Scripture; in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> you finde theſe words made uſe of by the Apoſtle concerning Chriſt; <hi>the brightneſſe of his glory, and the expreſſe Image of his perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I am to ſhew you that there are three perſons in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence, and that from Scriptures, both in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the New.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Scriptures in the Old Teſtament; to that purpoſe, take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your thoughts theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A plurality of perſons may be proved by that Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> where God ſpeaks of himſelf in the plural number; <hi>Let us make man in our Image;</hi> this notes more perſons in the Godhead than one; 'tis true, ſomething is urged by way of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. God ſpeaks by way of <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> unto the <hi>Angels,</hi> that they ſhould bear witneſſe of the works of Creation; it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual in Scripture, for God to ſpeak to the creatures; as in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>Hear oh heavens, and give ear oh earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſol.</hi> 1. Although God is ſometimes brought in in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaking unto the creature, yet it is impoſſible that this Scripture ſhould be expounded after this manner; For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe unto whom God ſpeaks, were companions with him in the work of Creation; <hi>Let us make man after our Image;</hi> now God did not make uſe of Angels <hi>as instruments</hi> in the work of Creation, not indeed could he ſo doe; For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every <hi>instrument</hi> muſt have ſubject matter to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but Creation doth nor preſuppoſe a ſubject, but make it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every <hi>inſtrument</hi> muſt have time to work in, but Creation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119240:40"/> is in an inſtant; and therefore when we read that God created the world by <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> 
               <hi>by whom</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>he made the world;</hi> this particle <hi>per,</hi> or <hi>by, non eſt nota inſtrumenti, ſed nota ordinis,</hi> notes not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality, but the order amongſt the divine perſons; for as there is an order in regard of themſelves, ſo in regard of their operations; <hi>operari ſequitur eſse;</hi> and hence it is, that although we read that God the Father made the world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet we do not read that <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> made the world by the Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God ſpeaketh unto thoſe perſons, after whoſe image man was to be made; Let us make man after our image; now man was not to be made after the image of Angels, but the image of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob ect.</hi> 2. God ſpeaks <hi>more magnatum,</hi> or <hi>more p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incipium,</hi> after the manner of great ones, who ſpeak in the plural number.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſol.</hi> 1. If God ſpeaks <hi>more magnatum,</hi> after the manner of great ones, why doth he not alwayes, or at leaſt frequently ſpeak after this manner? you will find God ſpeaking in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the moſt part in the ſingular number; even in this very book of <hi>Geneſis, Behold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.17. Gen. 9.9. Gen. 15.1. Gen. 17.1.</note> 
               <hi>I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth. Behold, I even I eſtabliſh my Covenant with you. Fear not Abraham</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I am thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward;</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If God ſpeaks in the plural number after the manner of great ones, then certainly he would ſpeak after this manner, when he diſcovers moſt of his royalty, and power, and Majeſty, as he did at the giving of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and yet there he ſpeaks in the ſingular number; <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2.<note place="margin">Exod. 20.2.</note> 
               <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis likely the Princes did at firſt ſpeak in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not to note their power and greatneſſe, but their modeſty and warineſſe; that it was not their deſign to rule according to will, but according to counſel; that they were willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with others, and to be guided by others; The wiſeſt Kings on earth will have their counſel, and it is no more than
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119240:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> needs; <hi>plus vident oculi, quam oculus,</hi> many eyes ſee more than one eye;<note place="margin">Eph. 1.11.</note> but Gods Counſel is his Will; <hi>Who worketh all things after the counſel of his own Will.</hi> Nor indeed is it ſafe or fit for any to govern arbitrarily, or purely by will, but he whoſe Will is his counſel, it is ſo far from needing a rule, that it is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 63.7, 8, 9, 10.</note>2. As a plurality of perſons, ſo a Trinity of perſons may be proved out of the old Teſtament; I ſhall mention, and only mention for brievity ſake, one place in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the ſeventh <hi>verſe</hi> you have mention made of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the Lord; in the ninth <hi>verſe,</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> called the Angel of his preſence; in the tenth <hi>verſe,</hi> of the <hi>holy Spirit;</hi> but they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have this doctrine more clearly delivered in the new Teſtament, as will appear by ſeveral inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3.16, 17.</note>1. At the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Trinity</hi> of perſons were clearly diſcovered; you may read the hiſtory; <hi>And Jeſus when he was baptized, went up strait way out of the water, and lo the heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending like a dove, and lighting upon him, and lo a voyce from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> Conſider here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have three names given ſeverally and particularly to three perſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He who ſpake with a voice from heaven was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He who was Baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> is called the Son.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He who deſcended in the ſhape of a Dove, is called the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There were three outward ſignes or ſymboles by which thoſe three perſons did manifeſt themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Father by an audible voice; the Word in heaven, is borne witneſſe to by a word from heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Son in the humane nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The holy Ghoſt in the ſhape of a Dove.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are deſcribed by three diſtinct actions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The one cries by a voice from heaven, This is my well-beloved Sonne, heare him; this could not be the voice of the Sonne, for then he would be Sonne to himſelf; nor can this
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119240:41"/> be attributed unto the Spirit, for then <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have been the ſon of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond, after his Baptiſme, prayes; <hi>Luke</hi> 3.21. <hi>It came to paſs, that Jeſus being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The third deſcended in the ſhape of a dove, and reſted upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to cloſe this particular, why might it not be ſaid, that the Father was baptized in <hi>Jordan</hi> as well as the Sonne? or that the Father deſcended in the ſhape of a dove, as well as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; or that the Sonne did all this, ſpeak with a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and was baptized in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and deſcended in the ſhape of a dove; if this were not a truth, that there are three perſons in the divine eſſence? hence the primitive Chriſtians uſed to ſay unto any one that doubted of the <hi>Trinity, abi ad Jordanem &amp; videbis,</hi> go to <hi>Jordan,</hi> and you will ſee a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. This doctrine may be proved from the inſtitution of the Ordinance of Baptiſme; <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> 
               <hi>and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and indeed, no wonder if God diſcovered himſelf to be three perſons, and one God at Chriſts Baptiſme, when the name of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> is as it were in faire and legible Characters, writ upon the forehead of the Ordinance of Baptiſme its ſelf; Baptiſme its ſelf, is as it were, baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost;</hi> now theſe I call the words of inſtitution; for although you have not here the firſt inſtitution of Baptiſme, <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who was called ſo from this very Ordinance, adminiſtring this Sacrament, and the Diſciples queſtionleſſe from the Command of Chriſt himſelf; the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>that Jeſus himſelf baptized not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 4.2.</note> 
               <hi>but his Diſciples;</hi> yet here you have a ſolemn command for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the forme of the adminiſtration thereof unto all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
            <p>And here conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt commands them to baptize, not in the names, but <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt;</hi> if you conſider them perſonally, ſo they have three names, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; if eſſentially, then but one name; <hi>unum nomen,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119240:42"/> una deitas,</hi> one God, one deity; and I <hi>obſerve</hi> farther, that which way ſoever we expound this phraſe <hi>in the name,</hi> either calling upon the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt (as ſome) or <hi>in the name,</hi> by the authority, or at the appointment of God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt (as others) or <hi>in the name,</hi> viz. for the ſervice, honour, and glory of God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt (as a third ſort) you muſt either make theſe to be three Gods, or elſe three perſons in the Godhead; for who is the object of our prayers but God? who hath authority to appoint Ordinances for his Church but God? whom are we to ſerve and worſhip but God alone? <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They were to baptize, not in the name of the Father by the Son, or by the Spirit; but in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Spirit, which notes the equality of the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, are ſo joyned together, that we are no leſſe baptized in the name of the Sonne, and of the Spirit, than of the Father; and therefore their deity is the ſame, their power and authority the ſame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An <hi>Article</hi> is thrice prefixed, and added to every one, <hi>baptizate in nomine</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Son, that holy Ghoſt; <hi>that Father</hi> whoſe voice you have heard from heaven; <hi>that Sonne,</hi> whom as yet you ſee in the humane nature; <hi>that holy Ghoſt,</hi> whom you have ſeen deſcending upon me in the ſhape of a Dove; Surely the repetition of this Article, doth not want its ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Emphaſis, <hi>that Father, that Sonne, and that holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This doctrine may yet further be cleared from that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour;<note place="margin">John 14.16.</note> 
               <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter;</hi> hence is plainly proved the perſonality of the Holy Ghoſt, he is called <hi>another Comforter;</hi> now he who is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Father and the Sonne, in the manner as to be called <hi>another comforter,</hi> is either diſtinguiſhed in regard of his eſſence, or in regard of his perſonal ſubſiſtence; not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his eſſence, for then he would be another God, and therefore he is <hi>another</hi> in regard of his perſonal ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:119240:42"/>4. You have a clear proof for this doctrine in the words of the Text; <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one;</hi> and to that purpoſe, conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. You have mention here of three witneſſes; now three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are three perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Word and holy Ghoſt are conjoyned in their Teſtimony with the Father, which is not competible to any creature; and leſt we ſhould doubt of this, it is expreſly ſaid even by Saint <hi>John</hi> himſelf, to be the witneſſe of God; <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. <hi>If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the witneſſe of men, the witneſſe of God is greater; for this is the witneſse of God which he hath teſtified of his Son;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, it is ſaid that he is the <hi>true God; ver.</hi> 20. <hi>This is the true God, and eternal life;</hi> let the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſhew me where any creature is called the <hi>true God;</hi> Concerning the Spirit alſo in this Chapter, it is ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 6. that he is truth it ſelf; <hi>It is the Spirit that beareth Witneſſe, becauſe the Spirit is Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If there be three witneſſes, whereof every one of them is God, the one not the other, and yet not many Gods, but one true God; the point is clear, there are three diſtinct perſons ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in one divine eſſence, or (which is all one) <hi>there are three perſons and one God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I am to ſpeak ſomething to the diſtinction of theſe three perſons; though they cannot be divided, yet they may be, they are diſtinguiſhed; many things in nature may be diſtinguiſhed, which cannot be divided; for inſtance, the cold and the moiſture, which is in the water, may be diſtinguiſhed, but they cannot be divided; Now that thoſe three perſons are diſtinguiſhed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By what hath been already ſaid, the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the holy Ghoſt the Father or the Son.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the words of the Text; here are three heavenly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes produced to prove that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Son of God, namely, <hi>the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt;</hi> now one and the ſame perſon, although he hath a thouſand names, cannot paſſe for three witneſſes, upon any faire or reaſonable account whatever; you may be ſure that God reckons right, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119240:43"/> he ſayes,<note place="margin">John 8.13.</note> 
               <hi>Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt,</hi> to be three witneſſes; <hi>there are three that bear record in heaven;</hi> ſo in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> charge our Saviour that he bare record of himſelf; (ſay they) <hi>thou beareſt record of thy ſelf, thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is not true;</hi> now mark what Chriſt replies, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>It is written in your Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>that the Teſtimony of two men is true; I am one that bear witneſſe of my ſelf, and the Father that ſent me, beareth witneſs of me;</hi> where you have our Saviour citing the <hi>Law</hi> concerning the validity of a Teſtimony given by two witneſſes; and then he reckons his Father for one witneſſe, and himſelf for another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſhall ſpeak a few words to the order of theſe divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; in order of ſubſiſtence, the Father is before the Son, and the Son before the holy Ghoſt. The Father, the firſt perſon in the Trinity, hath foundation of perſonal ſubſiſtence in himſelf; the Sonne the ſecond perſon, the foundation of perſonal ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence from the Father; the holy Ghoſt the third perſon, hath foundation of perſonal ſubſiſtence from the Father and the Sonne.</p>
            <p>Now although one perſon be before the other in regard of order, yet they are all equal in regard of time, Majeſty, glory, eſſence; this I conceive to be the reaſon why in the Scripture ſometimes you have the Sonne placed before the Father; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.14.</note> 
               <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the holy Ghoſt be with you all, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 1.1.</note> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Paul an Apoſtle not of men, neither by men, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father, who raiſed him from the dead.</hi> Sometimes the holy Ghoſt is placed before the Father, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Through him we have an acceſse by one Spirit, unto the Father.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2.18. Rev. 1.4, 5.</note> Sometimes before Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>John to the ſeven Churches in Aſia, Grace be unto you, and peace from him which is, and which was, and which is to come, and from the ſeven Spirits which are before the Throne</hi> (by the ſeven Spirits there, is meant the holy Ghoſt) <hi>and from Jeſus Chriſt who is the faithful witneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. The conſideration of this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that rule amongſt our Divines; <hi>ab ordine verborum nulla eſt argumentatio;</hi> there is no argument to be urged from the order of words. Now this ſhews, that although one perſon be before another in regard of relation, and order of ſubſiſtence,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119240:43"/> yet all are equal one with another in regard of eſſence.</p>
            <p>And therefore beware leſt you derogate the leaſt <hi>jota</hi> or tittle of glory, or Majeſty, from any of the three perſons. As in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a ſmall matter as to the body, may be a great matter as to the beauty of the body; cut but the haire from the eye brow, how diſfigured will all the face look. If you take away never ſo little of that honour, and glory, which is due to any of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons, you do what in you lies, to blot, to ſtain, to disfigure the faire and beautiful face of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. I am to enquire whether the myſtery of the <hi>Trinity</hi> may be found out by the <hi>light of nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſol.</hi> There are two things in the general, that I would ſay in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this queſtion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the light of nature</hi> without divine Revelation, cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>light of nature</hi> after divine Revelation, cannot op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>light of nature</hi> without divine Revelation, cannot diſcover it; and for that purpoſe take into your thoughts theſe following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If that which concerns the worſhip of God cannot be found out by the <hi>light of nature,</hi> much leſſe that which concerns Gods nature, eſſence, or ſubſiſtence; but the Antecedent is certainly true; For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the part of the worſhip and ſervice of God, which is inſtituted, and ceremonial, it is impoſſible that it ſhould be found out by the <hi>light of nature;</hi> for inſtance, what man could divine that the Tree of life ſhould be a Sacrament to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> How comes the Church to underſtand what creatures were clean, what were unclean? that the Prieſthood was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and not in the Tribe of <hi>Simeon,</hi> or the Trible of <hi>Judah?</hi> certainly theſe leſſons were not learned by the <hi>candle-light of nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As for that part of the ſervice of God, which is moral, all of that neither is not diſcoverable by <hi>natural light;</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If you conſult the ſeventh to the <hi>Romans,</hi> you ſhall find that there were ſome ſecret moral wickedneſſes which <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſee, which <hi>Paul</hi> could not have ſeen by the <hi>light of nature;</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:119240:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> no, although a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and by that means very expert in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law;<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If the <hi>light of nature</hi> be imperfect in us ſince the fall, which I ſuppoſe you will grant, then there may be many things moral now imperceptible by the <hi>light of nature,</hi> which it might and did ſee in its ſtate of perfection; and therefore it muſt needs be of dangerous import, to make the <hi>Law of nature</hi> a weak, faint, ſhadowing, imperfect light, the perfect rule, and only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of moral duties; to cry up the Law written in our hearts, is in this caſe to cry down the Law written in the Scriptures; this is as it were to pull the Sun in its noon-day brightneſſe, in its greateſt luſtre and glory out of the firmament, and to walk by the light of a Candle, a ſtinking ſnuffe in the ſocket, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gone out; this is to make the Primmer, the Horn-book, the <hi>A. b. c.</hi> of <hi>natural light,</hi> the higheſt piece of learning in morality.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Law of nature</hi> (to our ſhame and grief we may ſpeak it) is ſo obliterated and darkened, that it cannot ſhow a man the leaſt part of his wickedneſſe. <hi>Pelagius</hi> was a man of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and by his ſtudies and diligence, had ſnuffed the Candle of the Lord, and made it burn with a clearer ſhine; yet how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle could he ſee into this matter? It was his affection, that we are borne as well without vice, as vertue, <hi>tam ſine vitio, quam ſine virtute naſcimur;</hi> and we ſee all <hi>Popery</hi> to this very day, hold motions to ſinne not conſented unto, to be no ſinnes, but neceſſary conditions ariſing from our conſtitution, and ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi> had in innocency.</p>
            <p>But I forbeare; the iſſue of this particular is thus much, if that which concerns the worſhip and ſervice of God, cannot be found out by the <hi>light of nature,</hi> much leſſe that which concerns his eſſence and ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The doctrine of the Goſpel is called by the Apoſtle a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and a myſtery without controverſie; <hi>great is the myſtery of godlineſs!</hi> and what greater Goſpel-myſtery is there than the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which neither men nor Angels can comprehend, and both men and Angels muſt adore! Now if this doctrine be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable by <hi>natural light,</hi> it is no more a myſtery. <hi>The works of the fleſh are manifeſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.19, 20.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20. Now
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119240:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> why are they ſaid to be <hi>manifeſt?</hi> becauſe they ſtink in the noſtrils of nature, and are diſcernable by the dimme eye of conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Poſſibly ſome may ſay, man hath as it were the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or likeneſſe of a <hi>Trinity</hi> within himſelf; there are three prime faculties, underſtanding, will, and memory, in one and the ſame reaſonable ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſol.</hi> 1. A ſimilitude doth not prove a thing to be, but only repreſent a thing to our fancy, which at preſent hath, or at leaſt had a being one way or other; for inſtance, it is impoſſible that any Sonne ſhould know his fathers picture, unleſſe firſt he hath ſeen or heard, that his father was ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the picture doth repreſent; and by that means hath before hand, his fathers idea and image preſented in his own ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis denyed that theſe faculties in mans ſoul, bear the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or likeneſſe of a <hi>Trinity;</hi> neither can any man by a reflex act upon his own ſoul, attain to the knowledge of this great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; but ſuch notions as theſe are the luxuriant extravagancies of ſome curious braines, that would advance earth as high as heaven; and do indeed rather darken, then illuſtrate this truth; as he who would adde any colour unto light, doth rather ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh it than adorn it; what a piece of folly would it be to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to emblazon a ſun-beam?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> was known to ſeveral of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> which had not the Scriptures, and therefore is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable by the <hi>light of nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſol.</hi> 1. If the <hi>Heathen</hi> had any notions of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> they might receive them either by tradition, from thoſe who had read the Scriptures, or out of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not by the improvement of <hi>natural light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis very probable that theſe notions of a <hi>Trinity,</hi> which are found in <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> were not writ by them, but foiſted into their works by ſome that lived in after ages; my Reaſons are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe writings which go under the name of the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> are not all truly ſuch, but a great part of them ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, and forged; as Mr. <hi>Dally</hi> proves largely in that learned piece of his, called <hi>A Treatiſe of the right uſe of the Fathers;</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:119240:45"/> where he gives you an account of whole books that were publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the names of the Apoſtles, as Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> and others which were not ſuch. Now if men durſt be thus bold with the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> no wonder if they did not ſtick to deal thus with <hi>Heathens.</hi> This impoſture in the Primitive times was very ordinary; yea, the <hi>fathers</hi> themſelves have uſed this Artifice to promote their own opinions, as you may read large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the third Chapter of that book.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some are apt to believe, that there are clearer notions of a <hi>Trinity</hi> in ſome of the books of the Heathens, than in the books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſo by conſequence, the Heathens ſhould know more of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> than the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, which is flat contrary to the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Pſal. 76.1.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1. <hi>In Judah is God known, his Name is great in Iſrael; He hath not dealt ſo with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nation; and as for his judgements, thy have not known them; praiſe ye the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the firſt Aſſertion in anſwer to this queſtion, whither the myſtery of the <hi>Trinity</hi> may be found out by the <hi>light of nature?</hi> viz. that the <hi>light of nature</hi> without divine Revelation, cannot diſcover it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>light of nature</hi> after divine Revelation, cannot oppoſe it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the judgement of ſenſe ought not to be urged againſt the judgement of reaſon; ſo the judgement of reaſon ought not to be urged againſt the judgement of faith. The judgement of ſenſe, ought not to be urged againſt the judgement of reaſon; for inſtance, ſenſe tells us that ſome of the Stars are as ſmall as ſpangles (I am apt to believe, that ſome Country men think the Sunne to be no bigger than their Cartwheele) here reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes, corrects ſenſe, tells us, that there being a vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between us and them, they muſt needs be very great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or elſe they could not be viſible. There are thouſands of Stars that cauſe the white ſtreak in the heavens, called the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky-way,</hi> which are inviſible upon the account but now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. Senſe tells us, that the Sunne is of greater magnitude in the morning, and evening, than at noon; here reaſon again interpoſes, corrects ſenſe, tells us, it onely apeares ſo becauſe of the denſeneſſe, or thickneſſe of the air or <hi>medium;</hi> and that for the ſame reaſon, if you put a piece of money into a baſon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119240:45"/> of water, it will appeare of a larger ſize, than if it were in a baſon without water; that which I aim at is this, that as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth thus correct ſenſe, <hi>à pari,</hi> faith ſhould correct reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Philoſophical <hi>Axiomes,</hi> muſt be kept within their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bounds, and limited to a finite power; for inſtance, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> that out of nothing proceeds nothing, is a truth, if it be underſtood with reference to a finite power. So <hi>A priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad habitum non datur regreſſus,</hi> is a truth upon the ſame termes. <hi>Sic una numero eſſentia non poteſt eſſe in tribus perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis;</hi> that one and the ſame numerical eſſence, cannot be in three diſtinct perſons, is a truth limited, as before; I mean, with reference to a finite power; but all this, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Arguments more of this nature, cannot overthrow this principle, that there are three perſons, and one God; for we are not ſpeaking now of that which is finite, but of that which is infinite. Suppoſe this <hi>Queſtion</hi> ſhould be ſtarted; how the ſame numerical eſſence can be in three perſons? poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly an anſwer might be returned thus. Suppoſe a father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a ſonne, and communicates to him the ſame numerical ſoul and body which he hath ſtill himſelf, and both of theſe ſhould communicate the ſame ſoul and body to a third, here would be three diſtinct perſons, yet the ſame eſſence in them all; but I know a reply would quickly be made, This is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; anſwer muſt be made, It is true, as to that which is finite, but not unto that which is infinite, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The time allotted for this exerciſe being ſpent, in the handling of the doctrinal part of this Obſervation, I can ſpeak but a few words to the Uſe and Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This doctrine ſhould eſtabliſh us in the truth of the Goſpel, even this myſtery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manifeſt unto the Church; the <hi>Heathens</hi> as we have heard, could not attaine unto this knowledge <hi>by the light of nature;</hi> Oh what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is this, that we ſerve an incomprehenſible God! one God, and yet three perſons; to comprehend is to environ, and keep in all that God is; for my part, I would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that God that I could comprehend; the doings of God know no bounds, much more his eſſence and ſubſiſtence.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119240:46"/> Kings have their Crowns, a circle about their head, and ſhould alſo have a circle about their feet, they ſhould not go which way they pleaſe, but keep themſelves with n the limits of Law, both of God and man, and this ſpeaks them to be creatures, though in a greater letter, finite beings; but it is otherwiſe with God; as he will not have any Articles put upon him, ſo he cannot have any circles or lines drawn about him; for an infinite God to be finite and limited, is <hi>a contradiction in adjecto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us ſtudy this doctrine of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and as a motive to this conſider, we cannot worſhip God aright, without ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this truth. As God the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghoſt, are the object of divine faith, ſo are they the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of divine worſhip; we muſt worſhip <hi>Trinity</hi> in unity, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in <hi>Trinity;</hi> you may direct your prayers unto God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; but you muſt not pray unto either of the perſons, but as united unto the other. <hi>Gerard</hi> tells us in <hi>Loc. com. de ſanctiſſimo Trinitatis mysterio, cap.</hi> 1. that it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary in ſome meaſure to know this truth; and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the denial of the <hi>Trinity</hi> of perſons, but the ignorance of it is damnable;<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that ſometime they were <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> we render it <hi>without God in the world,</hi> but in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal it is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>It was motive enough to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to plead and zealouſly to conte d for the image of <hi>Diana,</hi> becauſe they ſaid it was that which fell from <hi>Jupiter, Acts</hi> 19.35.

            <p>There were even in the Apoſtles time ſeducers, (ſo you finde in the beginning of this Chapter) perſons that would reſiſt the truth, as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> reſiſted <hi>Moſes;</hi> Not only in the preſent age, (which is like the dregs of the world in compariſon of the Primitive times) but even then alſo there were ſeducers and deceivers; there are Comets among the Stars, as well as <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> that creep upon the earth; what muſt <hi>Timothy</hi> do? <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Continue thou in the things which thou haſt learned and haſt been aſsured of, knowing of whom than haſt learned them; and that from a childe thou haſt known the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>[From a childe] Joſ phus</hi> in his book againſt <hi>Apion</hi> tells us, the children of the Jews were ſo inſtructed in their Laws, that they could ſcarce name a Law to them, but they could tell it; more ſhame to us Chriſtians that take no care to teach Religion, that may much more eaſily be learned than the Jewiſh Religion could. <hi>[From a childe thou haſt learned the Scriptures]</hi> And it would be a ſhame for a perſon ſo long inſtructed, not to continue in this doctrine; a ſhame for an old profeſſor well educated to deſert the principles of his Religion, and forſake the truths of Scripture; do not forſake them, why? this verſe gives two reaſons; firſt, it is of <hi>divine revelation;</hi> ſecondly, it's <hi>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little to explain the words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God]</hi> Scripture in the Text, is the ſame with the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> ver. 15. for you muſt know that in the Bible, the word Scripture is commonly taken for the holy Scriptures; ſo <hi>ſearch the Scripture; ye erre, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture;</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 5.39. Matth. 22.29. John 10.33.</note> the <hi>Scripture cannot be broken;</hi> ſo you muſt underſtand it here, <hi>all Scripture,</hi> that is not every thing that is written, but the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is of Divine inſpiration]</hi> the meaning is, that the things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are not of humane invention, are not the contrivance of any mans wit, or any mans fancy; but they are the real revelations of the minde and will of God: And yet thoſe things which were
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119240:48"/> thus reveal'd, good men were excited to write them, and aſſiſted in it: I ſay, the inſpiration of God comprehends in it theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the truths contained in this Scripture were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of mans braine ot fancy: <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they who writ them were excited to it, and were aſſiſted in it by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The Text is both explain'd and confirm'd by the parallel place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Knowing this firſt, that no propheſie of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is of any private interpretation; for the propheſie came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That you may a little underſtand this Text, give me leave to gloſſe upon it. In <hi>ver.</hi> 16. the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>we have not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed cunningly deviſed fables, &amp;c.</hi> That which we have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and preached to you, was nothing cunningly deviſed by us, when we made known to you the power and coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; we ſaw him transfigured; we did not go about to tell you the ſtory our ſelves; but if you will not believe that, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of propheſie:</hi> There are predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Chriſt in the Old Teſtament, whereunto ye do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that ye take heed as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place untill the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts: Not as ſome Enthuſiaſts would interpret this, that men ſhould mind the Old Teſtament till the Spirit of God ſhould tell them the truth of this Scripture, and then throw away the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: No, it's a light that ſhines in a dark place untill the day dawns, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts. I'le give two inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations; either firſt, that this heart is the dark place till the day-ſtar ariſe, and ſo the word [untill] ſhall not refer to the word <hi>take heed,</hi> but only to <hi>dark place;</hi> mans heart is the dark place. But I rather take it till they ſaw the accompliſhment of thoſe Propheſies; till you ſee that really fulfilled which hath been Propheſied: Take heed, why? knowing this that no Propheſie of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is of any private interpretation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo we read the word; in the Greek it is, they are not of any private incitation and impulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the word hath reference to the cuſtome of Racers; now you know Racers do not ſet out when they pleaſe themſelves, but when he watch word is given: Now no Propheſie is of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interpretation, they did not go about nor ſet about it till God
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119240:49"/> really put them upon it; for it was not the effect of their own will, choice or invention, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt. Say the Papiſts, the Scripture is of no private interpretation; therefore you cann't underſtand it; but that is juſt as if I ſhould ſay. you muſt not put what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you will upon my words, and therefore you cann't underſtand them: The Scriptures being from God are not to any of private interpretation; (that is) to put any other meaning upon them than what God means; but it doth not follow what God means, cannot be underſtood; <hi>Luke</hi> 1.70. its ſaid that <hi>God spake by the mouth of the holy Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtles before they preached, were endued with power from on high, as you read in the <hi>Acts. Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, it pleaſed God to <hi>reveal his Sonne in him,</hi> Gal. 1.15, 16. by the Revelation of the Goſpel; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. <hi>If any man think himſelf to be a Prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you, are the Commandments of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> The grand enquiry will be, how may any man be truly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that this book is the Word of God? or that it hath Divine authority, or Divine inſpiration?</p>
            <p>I confeſſe 'tis an undertaking too great for me, but yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you have ſeen a little boat follow a great ſhip. That I may diſtinctly do it, and offer my own thoughts in this great enquiry, I ſhall give you what I have to ſay in theſe ſeven Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Prop. <hi>That there may be a Revelation from God, no man can doubt but</hi> an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> that <hi>thinks there is no God.</hi> That there has been a Revelation from God is acknowledged by the Gentiles; for they looked upon their Oracles as anſwers of their gods; and it is acknowledged alſo by the Jewes, who tell us that <hi>Moſes</hi> had their Laws from God upon the Mount, and all the Prophets were moved and excited by God to deliver their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands to them; ſince there is a God, God may make a Revelation of his minde.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>That there ſhould be a Revelation of Gods minde and will, every man cannot but grant it to be highly reaſonable;</hi> for alas, poor man is a ſinner, a pitiful dark blind thing; now he cannot but confeſſe though he hath no Bible, yet ſurely he is not what he was when he came out of Gods hand; but he is now ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and does not know all his duty, and he is backward to do
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119240:49"/> that which he does know, and if he was not backward, he could tell whether God would accept of it or not; therefore man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay it is a thing h ghly reaſonable that there ſhould be a Revelation of the will of God, that he might know his duty; and if he did do it, God would take it kindly at his hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Prop. <hi>We ought to have good ſatisfaction for that which we entertain as a Divine Revelation;</hi> for there are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come in Gods name, than have Gods commiſſion; a great many more ſay Thus ſayes the Lord, then ever were bid to ſpeak Gods Word; As we cannot believe we know not what, ſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe we know not why; whoever believes any thing, he hath ſome reaſon why he does believe it: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Continue in the things whereof thou haſt been aſſured;</hi>

                  </p>
               </note> not thoſe things which are concredited and truſted to thee, but thoſe things of which thou haſt been aſſured: Now ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 4.22. <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what;</hi> intimating perſons ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what, and why they worſhip; we are not born with this notion that this Bible is a beam of the Sunne of righteouſneſs; we muſt therefore ſee why we entertain it. That rule is excellent, though I muſt not nor cannot give a reaſon of every thing believed, (for many things far tranſcend all that my ſhort underſtanding is able to reach) yet I muſt, and I am bound to give a reaſon of all that I believe, becauſe God hath ſaid it. When the Goſpel was preached, the <hi>Bereans</hi> were commended for examining whether thoſe things were ſo or not. I am ſatisfied this Book is Gods Word, I have reaſon enough to believe whatever is reveal'd; for God is too good to deceive, and too wiſe to be deceived; and therefore ſhew me but that God hath ſaid it, and that it is really Gods minde, I have all the reaſon in the world to believe it; but now I muſt have ſome reaſon for which I believe that this book is the revelation of Gods minde and will.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Prop. <hi>Where we ought to be ſatisfied, there 'tis certain God hath given minds deſirous of ſatisfaction to ſee ſome ground for it;</hi> I mean ſince 'tis ſo great a matter, we ought not to be fondly credulous: No queſtion but God hath given ſufficient evidence of that he would have us maintain as the manifeſtation of his own pleaſure; for thus I argue, If we neither have nor can have any thing to diſcern what is from God, and what is not from God, then we muſt either reſolve to believe nothing at all, as never
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119240:50"/> knowing but that we may be cheated; or elſe believe what comes firſt to hand, be it what it will; therefore I ſay where God would have us entertain any thing of his minde, 'tis certain he gives us ſufficient evidence 'tis ſo. I ſay, God intended to give ſatisfaction to a minde that's deſirous of it; not to a man that is peremptory, wilful and reſolute of his own way, let God ſay what he will. God will not ſatisfie every angry Jew that will hold faſt his own preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; nor every ſenſual Gentile that lives in nothing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe; but an ingenuous ſpirit that willingly gives up himſelf to the truth of God, and lays down every prejudice, and is willing to be taught by him, this is the perſon to whom God intends real ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Prop. <hi>All the evidence which we have of any thing, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from reaſon or ſenſation:</hi> As it is impoſſible a man ſhould give credit to that which can no way be made credible; ſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is made credible to us, is made ſo from ſome faculty; now all our faculties are either ratiocination or ſenſation; either the workings of our underſtanding, or elſe things we feel; believe ſuch a thing, why? I feel it, ſee it, hear it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Prop. <hi>We have rational evidence this book we call the Bible is Gods Word, and of Divine Authori y.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Prop. <hi>Good men have inward ſenſations that this book is from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I am come to the grand buſineſſe. I have told you there may be a Revelation from God ſince there is a God; it's highly reaſonable there ſhould be ſuch a Revelation; we ought to have ſatisfaction in what we entertain as a Revelation of God; where we ought to be ſatisfied, God hath given it to a minde willing to entertain it; all the evidences we can have of a thing whereby we ſhould be ſatisfied, muſt either be from our reaſon or ſenſe; And now we have rational evidence, this book we call the Bible, is of Divine Authority.</p>
            <p>I will dwell but upon this one Argument, and before I ſpeak to it, give me leave to ask you this one queſtion; What would you deſire to give you aſſurance that any particular book or Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from God? this is a conſiderable queſtion; for whatſoever a ſober man could deſire to give him aſſurance this book is from God, he hath it; and if God ſay, thou hadſt all I could give thee, it would non-plus all at that day if they be found unbelievers.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:119240:50"/>
            <p>I can poſſibly deſire nothing but theſe <hi>three</hi> things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Methinks whatſoever ſhould come from God, ſhould preſſe holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and godlineſſe; ſhould preſſe ſuch a Religion, that if men love it, they ſhould be happy by it; and ſhould give ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to engage men to this Religion, as ſhould be proper to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhould think that the Publiſher of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhould himſelf be an exemplary perſon; for I could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily imagine God would ſend ſuch a perſon to bring in ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as ſhould deſtroy it by his own life, and bring to ruine by his works what he had ſpoken with his mouth. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhould expect ſuch a perſon ſhould work miracles to give us aſſurance he had a Divine Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Now let us make an enquiry whether we have not all theſe things; this great Argument Comprehends many things in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This book preſſes holineſſe and godlineſſe ſo as never did any in the world before nor ſince, and gives ſuch Arguments for it as never was heard of, nor the wit of man could ever have thought of. He that would walk in the Wilderneſſe of Paganiſm, might hear and there ſpy a flower growing amongſt many weeds; now and then a Philoſopher that gives you ſome good directions that concern righteouſneſſe and external behaviour; but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is a garden wherein whatſoever hath been recommended by all the ſober men in the world is put together, and wherein they were defective that's there made up; for they were defective e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in this one great point, deep humility; and though you ſhall finde many things that concern the exerciſe of ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an graces, yet in the real practice of humility, a man would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how incredibly they fell ſhort.</p>
            <p>But as for the Scripture; what would you have? it bids you live <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly, godly;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note> it bids you lie at Gods feet as his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to do with you what he will; it would have you like God himſelf; that's the end of the promiſes, <hi>that we ſhould partake of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. it bids you be <hi>holy as God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. it charges upon you whatever thing is <hi>good,</hi> is <hi>juſt,</hi> is <hi>lovely,</hi> Phil. 4.8. it commands your very thoughts; it's ſo far from ſuffering you to do hurt to your brother, as not to ſuffer you to think hurt; it's ſo far from allowing to act rapine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, as not to allow to do any thing that ſavours of coveting;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119240:51"/> it binds the very heart and ſoul: O what a place of univerſal calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would this world be, ſhould all ſerve one another in love; ſhould all ſtudy each others good, we ſhould never do injury; if any did, we ſhould forgive him, we ſhould endeavour to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as God is;<note place="margin">

            <p>Behold the Scripture is a doctrine according to godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. truth according to godlineſſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. the myſtery of godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. ſo that in one word, whatever God would think fit for man to do to that God that made him; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is fit for a ſinner to do to a holy God againſt whom he hath trangreſſed; and between man and man; all that is the deſigne of the Scripture.

Is it nothing ſinner, that thou wilt live fooliſhly, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? what wilt thou think to ſee God dwelling in humane nature? to ſee God live a poor, ſcorned, reproached, contemned life; intimating this great truth, that it's not ſo unſeemly a thing for the Sonne of God himſelf to live a poor miſerable life, as 'tis for a man to be an impenitent ſinner; if you remain a wilful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner, thou wouldſt in thy pride be like God, and have no Superiour above thee: Behold God condeſcends and becomes like to thee, that if poſſible he might bring thee back again; thou that art a ſinner, ſuſpecteſt whether God will do thee good; behold how cloſe he comes to thee, he dwells in thy own nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Behold <hi>the beloved Sonne of God dying upon the Croſſe for thee.</hi> What would you think if any of your Parents ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their childe to dye on the behalf of an enemy? would you not think it ſhould move that enemy? Behold my Sonne in whom I am well-pleaſed! methinks God takes not a quarter of that content in the whole Creation, which he does when he ſpeaks of his Sonne; yet this Sonne ſuffered for ſinne, the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that he <hi>might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. methinks this love ſhould <hi>conſtrain</hi> us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. Poor ſoul, thou art ready to think God is become thine enemy; when ſickneſſe and death comes, thou art ready to ſay, haſt thou found me O mine enemy? here's trouble in the world; how ſhall I know whether God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119240:51"/> good? Behold it's beyond peradventure, God intends good to a ſinner becauſe he dwelt in our nature, and his Sonne dyed for us, and his Sonne felt pain and infirmity, and therefore he may love thee, and you need not queſtion any thing of this nature is a hindrance of Gods love; the caſe of a ſinner is not ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but that a man may be accepted and loved of God for Chriſts ſake; will not this move you?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>You have promiſes of eternal life, and threatnings of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery:</hi> Never did any Philoſopher or any other man threaten, If you will not obſerve ſuch and ſuch precepts, Il'e throw you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal torments, nor never did any man ſay I will give you ſuch glory in heaven; but the Scripture does; behold <hi>life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality are brought to light by Chriſt;</hi> there's a future reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this body is like an old houſe pull'd down, by and by it will be a brave building again, a ſpiritual body, and we ſhall ſhine like the Sunne in the Firmament, and be equal to the Angels of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.43. and he like God and Chriſt: <hi>Now we know not what we ſhall be, but when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1, 2. And having this hope, who would not purifie himſelf even as God is pure? who would not live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, <hi>looking for that bleſsed hope,</hi> &amp;c? If you did but apprehend this glory,<note place="margin">Tit. 2 13</note> were not your minde ſenſeleſſe, its impoſſible you could be quiet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out getting an intereſt in it. And how great the day of judgment will be, it tells you; how our thoughts, words and actions, and every thing we go about ſhall come under a ſevere ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The worth of our ſouls;</hi> we minde our bodies, but a ſoul is better than a world. The Scripture ſaith, the Sonne of God dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſouls; we never underſtood ſo much what ſouls were wor h as now we do, when we ſee God taking ſuch care, and having ſuch deſigns and thoughts from all eternity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The faireſt and the moſt reaſonable condition of eternal happineſſe, and the greateſt ſtrength to perform it, that's offer'd in the Goſpel:</hi> Suppoſe we were ſenſible we were liable and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Gods wrath, and could go to heaven and beſeech God that he would be pleaſed not to execute that wrath upon us, do but think what terms you would be willing to propoſe to God; would you come and ſay, Lord, puniſh me not for what is paſt, though I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119240:52"/> intend to do the ſame thing; but he that ſhould ſay, Lord, forgive me, I am ſorry for that which is done, and it ſhall be the buſineſſe of my life to live more circumſpectly to thee; this is the great thing the Scripture propoſes to us: Godlineſſe in the Scripture hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the things of this life,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> and of things to come; whatever is good here, we are ſure of it in the practice of piety; and in the world to come as ſure of that happineſſe; but no more can tell what it is, then we can tell what the thoughts of all men have been ſince the firſt Creation.</p>
            <p>What Arguments can you imagine poſſibly God himſelf could propoſe greater or ſtronger than theſe? what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me from returning to God? That's the firſt part of the demonſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, we would expect the Publiſher of this Doctrine ſhould himſelf be exemplary,</hi> and ſo was Chriſt; <hi>Austin</hi> ſaid, the whole life of Chriſt was doctrinal, to lead us to piety and good practice, he <hi>went up and down doing good.</hi> Did any reproach him? he reproached them not again; was he reviled? he reviled not again; when he came to ſuffer, <hi>Father, not my will, but thine be done;</hi> there's not ſuch a word as that in all the pieces of Philoſophy, not ſuch an expreſſion of humility and ſurrender, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not my will, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An innocent perſon,</hi> ſo ſaith the Text; he is always denying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will not be rich and great in the world; why? he preſt you to lay up treaſures in heaven; he hath not a hole where to lay his head; why? becauſe he bids you to live upon Gods providence; he lived a ſingle life, bacauſe he would have you be as though you had not ſuch and ſuch relations; his very enemies could object nothing againſt him; have nothing to do with that juſt perſon, ſaid <hi>Pilates</hi> wife. I finde no fault in him, ſaith he that condemned him; not the Jews themſelves were ever able to inſtance in any evil practice; they only charged him, (and ſo do ſtill) that he wrought miracles by the Divel, which was the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; but they never could charge him with any evil practice; leaving us an example, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Learn of me, I am meek and lowly.</hi> Now what ſervant would not be willing to do that which his Maſter does before him?</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:119240:52"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, we would expect he ſhould work miracles to teſtifie that he had his commiſſion from God;</hi> for he that ſhall come to ſet up a new Law, a new Oeconomy, a new frame nd conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion, had need aſſure us that he is Gods meſſenger; if he work miracles, we cannot tell what to have more; for we certainly conclude that God will not ſuffer a long ſeries of things extraordinary and quite beyond the courſe of nature to be done to atteſt a lye: Miracles were bagun by our Saviour, and continued many hundred years after, juſt as props that are ſet under weak Vines; ſo theſe under the weak faith of the world when it firſt began.<note place="margin">

Baſil.</note> One ſaid excellently, that thoſe whom the ſpeaking tongue did not convince, the ſeeing eyes might certainly convince; that theſe were proper to convince that Chriſt came from God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.3.4. where when <hi>John</hi> ſent to know, Art thou he that ſhould come? that is, Art thou the Meſſiah? Go and tell <hi>John</hi> what you hear and ſee; The blinde receive their ſight, the lame walk, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaith, No man can do theſe miracles that thou doſt, except God be with him; and <hi>John</hi> 9.13. the blinde man ſaith he hath opened mine eyes, and how come you to ask how he did it? great ſigns ſhall follow them that believe, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17. and theſe continued in <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Tertullians, Cyprians</hi> time, <hi>Gregory Nyſsens</hi> time,<note place="margin">Vid. Montacut. Apparat. in Praefat.</note> and ſome part of <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> time.</p>
            <p>Concerning theſe miracles, give me leave to lay down three <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> then you will ſee the ſtrength of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They were famous and illuſtrious,</hi> for they were done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore multitudes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.22, 23. not done in a corner, <hi>John</hi> 9. when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raiſed, they ſaid, <hi>they could not deny it;</hi> at his death the Earth quaked, the Temple rent, there was darkneſſe for three houres which was obſerved by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as well as Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As they were done before a multitude, <hi>ſo there were a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of miracles,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>John</hi> ſaith, they were ſo many, that if all ſhould be written, the world could not contain the books that ſhould be written, <hi>John</hi> 21.25. That is an Hyperbolical expreſſion for a very great number.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:119240:53"/>
            <p>A learned man hath obſerved <hi>Eliſha</hi> did but twelve miracles, <hi>Elijah</hi> not ſo many; <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought about ſeventy ſix; and they which were done by them and all the reſt of the Prophets from the beginning of the world to the deſtruction of the firſt Temple, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted but to <hi>one hundred and fifty</hi> miracles; in <hi>three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred twenty eight years</hi> there were not as we finde in Scripture, ſo many wrought; but now Chriſt went about healing all manner of ſickneſſe, and curing all manner of diſeaſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. Queſtionleſſe a very vaſt number.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They were of all ſorts and of all kinds;</hi> a woman that had an iſſue of blood twelve years, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.20. and a woman that had a ſpirit of infirmity eighteen years, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.11. and one that had an infirmity thirty eight years, <hi>John</hi> 5.8. the dead were raiſed, the Divels were caſt out, the Sea commanded, the winds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; they are of all ſorts and kinds.</p>
            <p>Obſerve alſo this, that you do not read or finde by any thing that there was the leaſt of them done out of any oſtentation; there was no ſuch thing done by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, to call men out and ſay, Come, Il'e ſhew you what I can do, that ſhould ſhew any kind of arrogant affectation to themſelves; but the greateſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and modeſty runs through all the exerciſe of this mighty power, and this practice was ordinary among the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors then; yea, the Galatians they received that ſpirit by which miracles were wrought among themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, ſuch famous miracles were a ſufficient ground to make men believe this holy doctrine, who ſaw the miracles wrought by them that preached it;</hi> for if they did not, it muſt be either becauſe they queſtioned whether the things were done, or whether done by God or not; they could not queſtion whether the things were done; for they ſaw ſome raiſed out of their graves, &amp;c. Nor could they queſtion whether this was from God or not; for obſerve, Where I ſee miracles wrought, there I am bound to believe that they give teſtimony to what is preached by him that works them, except that which is preached, is that of which I am infallibly aſſur'd already, it cannot be true, except God does by ſome greater miracle contradict the teſtimony of thoſe miracles; as now the Egyptians they wrought miracles, but God contradicted all their teſtimony by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Now obſerve, the end of all Chriſtian Religion is to preach truth, to glorifie God, to honour
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119240:53"/> God, to ſave a mans ſoul. Never was there any exerting of Gods power to contradict it; ſo that if a man may not believe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thus holy, a doctrine thus practiſed by him that publiſhed it, and confirmed by miracles, then a man is under an impoſſibility of ever being ſatisfied from any thing from God; for what ſhall ſatisfie? If God ſpeak to us from heaven, we ſhould as much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that, as if an Angel come from heaven we ſhould ſuſpect him; but ſince we believe and know there's a God, and he is juſt and merciful, it's impoſſible the divine goodneſſe ſhould conſent to ſuch Impoſtors.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay what are theſe miracles to us?</p>
            <p>I ſay therefore <hi>thirdly, they are a ſufficient reaſon to engage us to believe the divinity of this holy doctrine, though we never ſaw them.</hi> You do not ſee Chriſt your ſelves, nor did you ſee him dye nor work miracles, but would you have had Chriſt live alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you? If you would, he muſt then never dye, and the great comfort of our life depended upon his death; he dyed, is riſen, and gone to heaven; would you have him come down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and dye that you might ſee it? and would you have him dye quite thorow the world at the ſame time? which muſt be if you would imagine we muſt ſee every thing our ſelves; it's a great piece of madneſſe to believe nothing but what we ſee our ſelves: <hi>Auſtin</hi> was troubled himſelf in this caſe,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>6.</hi> Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> he had been cheated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now he was reſolved he would believe nothing but what ſhould be plain to him; at length (ſays he) O my God thou ſhewed'ſt me how many things I believed which I ſaw not; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I believed I had a father and mother, and ſuch perſons were my Parents; how can I tell that ? a man may ſay, it may be he was drop't from heaven, and God made him in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way; ſo if I never were out of this Town, it's madneſſe for a man to ſay there's never another Town in <hi>England;</hi> or to ſay there is no Sea becauſe I ſaw it not. Nay, if a man come and tell me there's this doctrine that teaches me all ſelf-denial, mortification, weanedneſſe from the world, and ſay this is of God, and when he hath done ventures life, children, family, have we not reaſon to believe it? If you will not believe, 'tis either becauſe the firſt perſons were deceived themſelves, or elſe becauſe you think they would deceive you; now deceiv'd themſelves they could not be, when they ſaw ſo many miracles done; and deceive you, that they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119240:54"/> would not neither; for would any good man to deceive an other, undo himſelf? they dyed for it, and writ this book, and ſealed it with their blood; and therefore there can be no reaſon to doubt of it; they were witneſſes, and delivered what they ſaw, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Prop. <hi>As we have rational evidence the Scripture is the Word of God, ſo we have evidence alſo from inward ſenſation;</hi> born we are with principles of conſcience, and the truths in this book are ſo homogeneal to man, that he ſhall finde ſomething within himſelf to give teſtimony for it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. <hi>By manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the truth, commending our ſelves to every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſight of God.</hi> Joh. 5.44. Men believe not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they receive honour one of another; and in Scripture they that would not believe, are they that would not repent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.28 to the 33. men that practice drunkenneſſe, whoredome, ſenſuality, covetouſneſſe, pride, and know that theſe things are ſinnes, they are the great unbelievers, becauſe they are loth to leave their ſins; offer the greateſt reaſon in the world for a thing, if it be againſt a mans intereſt, how hard, and almoſt next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible is it to convince him? A man would believe that the Romans were in <hi>England</hi> that reads the Roman Hiſtory; but if he ſhall finde the coyne of the Roman Emperour, he will much more believe it. Do a bad action, O the ſecret terrours that a man finds within him, as if he felt ſomething of hell already! Do a good action, and the ſecret ſweetneſſe, joy and peace that attends it, that he cannot but ſay I believe it, for I feel ſome degrees of it already! 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25, &amp;c. he ſpeaks to the inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his conſcience. The reaſon men believe not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is not becauſe 'tis unreaſonable to believe them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a deſperate love to ſinne, and they are loth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain that that ſhould check their intereſt. There is in every life that certain ſagacity by which a man apprehends what is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to that life, what nouriſhes that life; a man that lives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law written in his heart, finds there's that in this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that feeds, nouriſhes, and encourages it; ſo that this man finds experimental ſatisfaction in it. Doth the Word of God tell me the wayes of God are pleaſant? I thought they were hard and difficult, now I finde the yoke of Chriſt is eaſie, and that no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe like this, and no bleſſedneſſe like that; I thought if I did
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119240:54"/> not comply with ſuch things I could never be bleſſed; now I finde I need nothing to make me happy but my God; he finds and feels theſe things are certan, true and real. Thus I have done with the demonſtration.</p>
            <p>You will eaſily obſerve I have neither taken notice of what the Papiſts tell us, we muſt believe the Scripture becauſe the Church ſaith it; we cannot tell what the Church is till the Scripture had told us.</p>
            <p>And though I have not mentioned the teſtimony of the Spirit, yet I ſuppoſe I have ſpoke to the thing; for I cannot underſtand what ſhould be meant by the teſtimony of the Spirit, except we either mean miracles wrought, which in Scripture is called the teſtimony of the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.8, 9. the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, it's the giving of thoſe extraordinary miracles that fell down among them, ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.32. I ſay if by the teſtimony of the Spirit you mean this, then you can mean nothing elſe but the Spirit aſſiſting, enabling, helping our faculties to ſee the ſtrength of that Argument God hath given us, and by experience to feel what may be felt, which comes under the head of ſenſation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> then <hi>ſtudy the Scripture:</hi> If a famous man do but write an excellent book, O how do we long to ſee it! or ſuppoſe I could tell you that there's in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> a book that God himſelf writ, I am confident men may draw all the money out of your purſes to get that book; you have it by you, O that you would ſtudy it: Wnen the Eunuch was riding in his Chariot, he was ſtudying the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he was not angry when <hi>Philip</hi> came, and as one would have thought asked him a bold queſtion; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> he was glad of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 8, 27, 28. one great end of the year of releaſe was that the Law might be read, <hi>Deut,</hi> 31.9. it's the wiſdome of God that ſpeaks in the Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.49. therefore whatever elſe you mind, really and carefully ſtudy this Bible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, in all enquiries into the truths of the minde of God conſult thoſe ſacred Oracles;</hi> here are Mines of truth, O dig here, make them the rule of faith and life; while a Papiſt makes the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119240:55"/> Church his rule, and the Enthuſiaſt pretends to make the Spirit of God his rule, do you live by Scripture; conſider what I ſay, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. <hi>conſider</hi> (there's thy duty) <hi>what I ſay, (there's the Scripture)</hi> yet <hi>Timothy</hi> was as good a man as any of us; <hi>and the Lord give thee underſtanding,</hi> (there's the work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to aſſiſt our faculty.)</p>
               <p>But how ſhall I finde out truth by Scripture? For thy own ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction remember this, have an explicite faith in all that plainly appears to be Gods minde, and have an implicite faith reſolving to be of Gods minde in all the reſt; be it what it will be, believe it, becauſe it appears to be of God; while a perſon reſolves to be of the Churches minde, be thou of Gods; only uſe all means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mayſt come to know; to wit,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of paſſion and ſenſual luſts. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. you read of ſome that will not <hi>endure ſound doctrine, but after their own luſts ſhall heap to themſelves Teachers.</hi> A luſt or paſſion is like a whirle-pit, a man is ſuck't up in it; ambition, ſenſuality, any of theſe darken and blinde a mans minde; when a man ſtudies any thing the minde had need to be quiet; luſts and paſſions are always buſie and boiſterous, and make a man have a great intereſt againſt God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And beware of prejudice; Chriſt ſaid, Go preach to all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29. but <hi>Peter</hi> lived under prejudice, and he ſaid, Lord, I never eat any thing common or unclean, when God bade him go to the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beware of taking truth upon the Authority of men, for that is fallible: Modeſty requires you ſhould have a fair reſpect to Preachers, and the Church of God where you live; but as to the vitals of your Religion, do not take them upon Authority; though a man would not willingly deceive you, yet he may be deceived himſelf in things controverted. In plain things of Scripture, that we muſt be humble, holy, believe, repent, all the world ſhould not perſwade you out of your Religion; and as for your duty you underſtand it; never a one but knows what he is to love when God bids us love him; if we would but familiarize our Religion, we could not but underſtand it; but in matters wherein there's a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute &amp; controverſie in the world, be quiet and ſober, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that ſuch and ſuch things muſt needs be ſo, becauſe ſuch ſay ſo?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119240:55"/> many pretend a kinde of ſanctity, and pretend for God, and a Ship may carry very broad ſails, yet not very well loaden; but thus it is, one man draws a multitude, and then a multitude pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails upon particular perſons, and ſhall I go againſt a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? I ſay therefore take not things upon authority, ſee and examine thy ſelf; if it be plain in Scripture, mind it, and own it, and charge thy ſelf with it: if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, think it no farther concerns thee than God hath made it manifeſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beware of Idleneſſe; ſearch the Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. Conſider what I ſay, &amp;c. They that are buſied for veines of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they hold the rod even poized in their hand, till at length it moves in that vein where it lies in the earth; So hold your ſouls even in a diligent enquiry into the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beware of pride; <hi>the humble man God will teach;</hi> proud men ſcorn others, they will not be taught; and pride, that will make a man to neglect prayer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Charge your ſelves with that which is the end of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to live well; Who would go about to read a piece of law, that he may learn Mathematicks? or read the ſtatutes to learn Logick? you may as well do ſo, as read the Scripture to talk only; but the intent of the Scripture, is to ſhew how you ought to live godly, to be juſt, righteous, ſober, to act by rule. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders knowledge ſo much as a bad life; for ſin brought in ignorance, and holineſſe will bring in the beſt light. There's a great deal of difference betwixt wit and wiſdome. Many have parts enough to be witty, but none but ſober and conſcientious perſons will have true wiſdome. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9. <hi>A ſcorner ſeeks knowledge, and finds it not.</hi> Scorners uſually are witty men, men of brave parts; a man that hath a mind only to practice wit, is never ſatisfied in the things of God. <hi>He that doth my will, ſhall know the doctrine that is of God.</hi>

               <p>There are a thouſand things diſputed in the world, errors upon errors, but I thank God it is plainly revealed, God hath mercy for a ſinner in Chriſt; I underſtand well what 'tis to live ſoberly, righteouſly, godly; I know what 'tis to honour my Parents, and do in my relations what becomes me; and I know theſe are the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119240:56"/> conditions of eternal happineſſe; I can but uſe all humane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, I can but beg of God, and charge my ſelf to love what I know; ſo that I am able to ſay at the day of judgement, what appeared to be the mind of God I obſerved it; what did not appear, I uſed all means to underſtand it; I would not haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine my ſelf till I ſaw thy mind, becauſe I knew there were impoſtors; and if this be done, if men will rangle and make controverſies where God hath made none, let them, for there will be no end of vanity and folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Seek dayly that your belief may be ſtrengthened, that this book is of divine authority;</hi> for what will enable you to reſiſt temptation, if you do not believe the Scripture? 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.14. I write unto you young men, ſaith the Apoſtle, becauſe ye are ſtrong; Why? the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one; you will never be ſtrong and overcome the evil one but by vertue of the Word of God. If ſin tempts you, if you look into the Scripture there's peace, good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the joy of God, and eternal life; and ſhall I for a trifle loſe theſe? no, while we have Scripture, we have an Antidote againſt all the devils poyſon. Again, what will bear you up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your afflictions if you loſe the belief of the Scriptures? you will need it when you come to be ſick and dye; when you bury your friends and relations, what will ſatisfie a mans mind? there's an after-glory; when friends come after me, or go before me, we ſhall all meet in joy; Did I but believe this glory, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve when the Sun ſets it will riſe again, were I but perſwaded what God hath ſaid is true, as now I am perſwaded I ſpeak, how ſhould I long for this glory? how would every child wail for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance? how ful of prayers? how chearful in our ſpirits? how ſhould we welcome death? how ſhould we long til theſe Tabernacles of duſt were crumbled to nothing? when affliction comes, how ſhould I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in that I believe that all ſhall work for good becauſe I love God? with what a quiet ſpirit ſhould I paſſe through the great Wilderneſſe of this World? The devil knows if he can but beat you from this ſort, he will quickly beat you out of all other ſorts. Let the Word of God come to you with much aſſurance, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. With the full aſſurance of underſtanding, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi> 2.3. you muſt not underſtand there he ſpeaks in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119240:56"/> to their perſons, to aſſure them they were the children of God, but that their faith had a good foundation in it ſelf, that this was from God, the truth of a good aſſurance in judgement.</p>
               <p>Take this further advice, If you would keep up your faith, be true to your faith; be ſure you live well; you will alwayes finde men make ſhipwrack of a good conſcience and of faith together, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10, 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. Remember the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles advice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Be not conformed to this world, but be renewed in your minds, that you may prove what is the good and acceptable Will of God.</hi> Never fear it, while thy mind is but willing to be rul'd by God, while thy ſoul is teachable and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, this will give thee evidence this book is from God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept melancholy overcome thee, which leads men to be Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, except in that caſe which is the proper effect of a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and muſt be cured by phyſick; but let a man have a mind to live well, and to be rul'd by the Word, the Bible is the beſt thing in the World to ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>I might have ſpoken to a caſe of conſcience concerning the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Chriſtians to the Word of God, that it is not equal in all, nor equally in the ſame perſon alwayes; and that a man may really believe that in the general of his life, which at ſome particular times he may doubt of; and a man may not be fully ſatisfied in the truth of the Scriptures, yet that man may really live under the power of it.</p>
               <p>To conclude all with this: ſince we have this reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture is Gods Word, then never wonder that you find Miniſters, Parents, Maſters, to preſſe real piety upon you, and ſee what great reaſon you have to entertain it. Alas, it may be you wonder we Preach and preſſe Religion; we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwaded, if you do nor love this Religion, you will be intolerably miſerable; and we have ſo much compaſſion for you, that ſince we know this to be Gods Word, better to be burned in the hotteſt fire, than to lie in thoſe torments. We know ſince God hath ſaid it, there is no comfort too great to them that comply with it; no judgement too ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to thoſe that will oppoſe it; therefore you cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we do from day to day preſſe it upon you.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:119240:57"/>
               <p>Conſider if it be Gods Word, then the threatenings are true, and the Promiſes are true, and you ſhall either have the promiſes or the threatenings within a while; God knows which of us ſhall be next, for 'tis but a little while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death, and judgement come; then either Come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or Go ye curſed; As a man hath wrought, ſo he ſhall have, for he will render to every one according to what he hath done in the fleſh; therefore knowing the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Lord, we perſwade you; we know this is of Divine ſtamp and Authority. I conclude all with the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi> 32. &amp;c. <hi>And now, Brethren, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to God, and to the Word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi>

            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt to prove that ſinne is no poſitive bang; but I take the Argument to be irrefragable, (notwithſtanding the Cavils made againſt it) that is drawn from that common Maxime,<note place="margin">

            <p>Nor is it in the leaſt ſtranage that man ſhould be at firſt created with a defectible holineſſe; for if he were immutably holy, either it muſt be <hi>ex naturâ,</hi> or <hi>ex gratiâ; ex naturâ</hi> it could not be, for that would ſuppoſe him God; if it were <hi>ex gratiâ,</hi> then it muſt be <hi>free;</hi> then it might be, or might not be; therefore there was no incongruity in it that it ſhould not be.

            <p>When God would communicate his goodneſſe to the creatures,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119240:65"/> he made the world out of nothing for his own glory, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man after his Image; this inferiour world he provided for mans houſe and habitation; but he dreſſeth and trimmeth one part for him eſpecially, and calls it <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> In the Paradiſe or pleaſant Garden he was not to live idly, but muſt dreſſe and keep it. In the midſt of all mans enjoyments which the Lord allows him with a liberal hand, yet he lets him know withall he was under ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though Lord of all, and therefore gives him a command; <hi>obſequii examen, &amp; obedientiae quoddam rudimentum;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
               <hi>a teſt and tryal of his obedience to which God trains him up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Lords when they let out their Lands to Husbandmen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſomewhat to themſelves which the Tenants are not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with, that they may have ſome check upon them;<note place="margin">Muſcul.</note> ſo God here. That which the Lord commands <hi>Adam</hi> was no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he grants him a vaſt latitude to eat of all freely,<note place="margin">Oecol.</note> only one ſort excepted, in which exception, as God was not envious to him, (as the <hi>Envious One</hi> ſuggeſted) ſo was not this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment grievous to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It may be objected from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man;</hi> why then for <hi>Adam</hi> in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſol. Paul</hi> means good men do not ſo need the Law as bad men do; <hi>for good Laws roſe from evil manners;</hi> yet in a ſenſe the Law is given for righteous men, not to juſtifie them, for it finds them juſtified already, and paſt the condemnation of the Law; it finding them alſo ſanctified,<note place="margin">Beza.</note> it treats them not as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but leads them, and delights them conſenting to it. This ſerves to explode the errour of <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Libertines;</hi> ſo then God to declare his Soveraignty, and mans ſubjection, gave <hi>Adam</hi> though innocent, a Law. Mark how God bound mans obedience with a double fence; firſt, he fenced him with a free indulgence to eat of all but one, this was an Argument to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity; ſecondly, by a ſevere prohibition upon pain of death; by the firſt the Lord wooes him by love; by the ſecond he frights him by the terrour of his juſtice, and bids him touch it if he durſt.</p>
            <p>Obſerve among all the Trees of the Garden there are two here mentioned in a more peculiar manner; the Tree of life, and the Tree of knowledge, which are called by Divines two <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:119240:66"/> in a large ſenſe; in which ſenſe alſo, <hi>the Ark of Noah, the fire which deſcended and burn't the Sacrifice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polanius.</note> 
               <hi>the Baptiſme of the Red Sea and Cloud, the Manna, the water out of the Rock, the pouring out of the blood of the Sacrifices, the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, the Tabernacle, Temple, Ark of the Teſtimony, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory, the golden Candleſtick, the twelve ſtones taken out of Jordan, with the pool of Betheſda;</hi> all theſe I ſay in a large ſenſe are <hi>Sacramental Symbols</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, or <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sacraments;</hi> but the Tree of knowledge, and Tree of life, are called Sacraments of the Covenant of works.</p>
            <p>By theſe the Lord did ſignifie and ſeal to our firſt Parents, that they ſhould alwayes enjoy that happy ſtate of life in which they were made, upon condition of obedience to his Commandments; <hi>i. e.</hi> in eating of the Tree of life, and not eating of the Tree of knowledge.</p>
            <p>For it was called the <hi>Tree of life,</hi> not becauſe of any native property and peculiar vertue, it had in it ſelf to convey life; but <hi>Symbolically, Morally and Sacramentally,</hi> it was a ſign and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to them of life natural and ſpiritual to be continued to them, as long as they continued in obedience unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Aug.</note>In like manner the <hi>Tree of knowledge of good and evil</hi> was ſpoken, from the ſad event and experience they had of it, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> had of God departed from him when he left his Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiſh haire by <hi>Dalilah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that a <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> lay in this Commandment is clear; 1. Becauſe that was the condition of mans ſtanding and life, as it is expreſly declared; 2. Becauſe in the breach of that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given him, he loſt all.</p>
            <p>This obedience as it was <hi>Characteriſtical</hi> to <hi>Adams</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and <hi>Contradiſtinguiſhed</hi> to the Covenant of Grace, was <hi>perfect, perſonal,</hi> and <hi>perpetual.</hi> In a ſenſe, though different from the other, thoſe three things are required in our obedience under the Covenant of Grace, not in reference to the Covenant, nor to juſtification; neither is our perſonal righteouſneſſe perfect, I mean legally; yet is it perfect, though not in us, but in our ſurety; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Covenant made primarily with us, but with him, and with us in him, and on his account; even as God made the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works primarily with <hi>Adam,</hi> and with us in him as our head incluſively.</p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What ground we have to ſpeak of Gods Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> and to call it a Covenant, there being no mention of it here in the Text, nor elſewhere in Scripture do we read of Gods Covenant with <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> However the name be not here, yet the thing is here and elſewhere, comparing Scripture with Scripture; it is a nice ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in <hi>Socinians</hi> to call fot the word <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> others for the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> others for the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> others for the words <hi>Faith alone juſtifying,</hi> others for the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> for Lords day, &amp;c. and thence to conclude againſt Satisfaction, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Trinity, Juſtification by faith alone, and Sabbath, for want of expreſſe words, when the things themſelves are lively ſet down in other words; ſo in this caſe of Gods Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> we have 1. Gods Command which lays man under an obligation. 2. We have Gods promiſe upon condition of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 3. We have Gods threatning upon his diſobedience; 4. We have their underſtanding it ſo, as appears in <hi>Eves</hi> words to the Serpent. 5.<note place="margin">Chap. 3.3.</note> We have the two Trees as ſigns and ſymbols of the Covenant. 6.

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. Wherein then doth this Covenant of Works conſiſt? what is the nature, tenour and end of it as ſuch?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Covenant required working on our part as the condition of it for juſtification and happineſſe; therefore called a Covenant of Works;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.12.</note> thus before, <hi>the man that doth theſe things ſhall live.</hi> Working indeed is alſo required under grace now; but 1.

Not previous to faith, which <hi>worketh by love, and lives by working, but man lives by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond <hi>Characteriſtical ſigne</hi> of the Covenant of Works is this, that in and under it man is left to ſtand upon his own legs and bottome, to live upon his own ſtock, and by his own indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; he had a power to ſtand, and not to have fallen; this is meant when it is ſaid, <hi>God created man in his own Image.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In the firſt Covenant, namely, that of Works; man had no need of a Mediatour; God did then ſtipulate with <hi>Adam</hi> immediately; for ſeeing as yet he had not made God his enemy by ſin, he needed no days-man to make friends hy interceſſion for him.</p>

            <p>And hence <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was not properly a Covenant of Works,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> becauſe that Law <hi>was given in the hand of a Mediatour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Covenant of Works once broken, God abates nothing of his juſtice, no not upon repentance, <hi>but the ſoul that ſinned, dyed.</hi> Mark our Text, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> by which dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the words in the Hebrew <hi>Idiom</hi> of ſpeech, is meant <hi>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Lord in the Covenant of Works accepts the perſon for the Works ſake; that is, he mainly looks at the work how ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate it is to the command and rule which he ſo exactly heeds, that upon the leaſt failer his juſtice breaks out in wrath, neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſonal excellency in the world ſalve the matter;<note place="margin">Deut. 27. ult.</note>

            <p n="6">6. The Covenant of Works in performance of the condition leaves a man matter of boaſting and glorying in himſelf, and makes God a debtour to him.</p>

               <hi>Where is boaſting? it is excluded; by what Law? of works?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.27.</note> 
               <hi>Nay;</hi> as if he had ſaid; the Covenant of Works affords matter of boaſting to him that worketh to juſtification by his own perſonal power and righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now to him that worketh is the reward reckoned, not of grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>but of debt;</hi> i. e. it obligeth God to pay it him as a due, which is the language of <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Papiſts;</hi> which were juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged and claimed; 1. Were we indeed under a Covenant of Works, and not of Grace; 2. Were our works perfect: 3. Did we not lye at Gods mercy for our guilt; All which declare man impotent, and grace neceſſary, and withal <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to be enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt and Covenant of Grace, and under a Covenant of Works, of which more anon.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Covenant of Works leaves a man ſtill in doubt while reſting in it, in that ſtate, becauſe it is a mutable ſtate at beſt; he had all in his own hands, and then Satan cunningly rooked him of all: God puts him into a good bottome, and leaves him to be his own Pilot at Sea; the Divel aſſaults him, and ſinks him; and therefore the ſecond Covenant takes all into Gods hands, that it may continue ſafe under his Father by care and cuſtod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29. and ſo gives the ſoul good ſecurity againſt death and danger, which <hi>Adam</hi> had not while he ſtood; much leſſe can any rich or honourable man in his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119240:69"/> fools Paradiſe here in this world, ſay his Mountain is unmoveable, his glory unchangeable, ſeeing it paſſeth away as <hi>a Pageant,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.31. if <hi>Adams</hi> Paradiſe was ſo mutable, much more theirs; if he ſtood not in his integrity, how ſhall they ſtand in their iniquity?</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Covenant of Works was made with all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> who was made and ſtood as a publick perſon, head and root in a common and comprehenſive capacity; I ſay it was made with him as ſuch, and with all in him: <hi>Quo manſit remanente, &amp; quo pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unte peribat;</hi> he and all ſtood and fell together; for even the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect may ſay, <hi>We are all by nature the children of wrath as well as others;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note> and that of St. <hi>Paul, We know that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Covenant of Grace is a <hi>diſcriminating</hi> thing; it takes in ſome, and leaves out others; Chriſt is not a head in Covenant with all, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, but of his Elect only; for we finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the world under the headſhip of Satan and Antichriſt, and old <hi>Adam,</hi> who are out of Chriſt, not only becauſe unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Saints themſelves are before regeneration, but out of Chriſt in the account of Gods <hi>Election, Donation</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> who have none of his <hi>ſpecial love,</hi> nor ever ſhall have.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly opened the <hi>diſtinguiſhing Characters</hi> of the Covenant of Works, which might have been more enlarged by thoſe of the Covenant of Grace, which is eaſily done by way of oppoſition and compariſon one with the other; and therefore, and for brevities ſake I omit it; and come to the next queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Whether this Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam,</hi> was revived and repeated to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> time; and if ſo, in what ſenſe, and why?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer affirmatively, that in ſome ſort the Covenant of Works was revived and repeated to them, which appears from theſe grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were tyed to Commandments under a curſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Gal.3.10. Deut. 28 1, 2. &amp; ver. 15.16.</note>2. Bleſſing is promiſed to obedience; they are both ſet down by <hi>Moſes</hi> at large in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> chap. 28. and elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:119240:69"/>3. It is expreſly called a Covenant, I mean the giving of the Law for obedience.</p>
            <p>The Lord God made a Covenant with us in <hi>Horeb.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 5.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is oppoſed to the Covenant of Grace as another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant upon this very diſtinguiſhing account of obedience and faith, works and grace, as you may ſee at large among other places in that of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 8.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are foure principal ends which the Lord had in ſo doing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he might hereby make men know what ſin is, how prone we are to it, and how averſe and head-ſtrong againſt all good; this is done by a Law of Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. to the 13. <hi>ver.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is Gods clear glaſſe by which he diſcovers to us the moral and penal evil of ſin; ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That hereby the Lord might hold men in to obedience by a ſtrong curb; becauſe we are ſo apt to break fence, he <hi>hedgeth up our way with thornes,</hi> Hoſ. 2.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That God might ſtop every mouth, and make all guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> Rom. 3.19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That men may hereby be laſh't and driven to Chriſt as with a <hi>School-maſters</hi> rod, to ſee an abſolute need of him, and to make out hard after him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>For men care not to run to a City of Refuge unleſſe the avenger of blood follow behinde at their heels; neither do the whole need or regard the Phyſician, but the ſick and wounded.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, they were not properly under a Covenant of Works, neither was the law given to them as ſuch a Covenant meerly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe as the Law was to convince of ſin, ſo it ſhewed the expiation of ſin, and therefore their Sacrifices were killed and the blood ſhed and ſprinkled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22, 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was not made with all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception as <hi>Adams</hi> was, but only with a ſelect people, even with <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Lord ſtill puts them in minde of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which included Chriſt, and faith in him,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.16, 17.</note> and was not null by the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. The laſt queſtion is how long this Covenant laſted, and whither any be under a Covenant of Works?</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:119240:70"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Moſt ſtrictly it was but to the giving of the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for then the Covenant of Grace began, but was more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly revealed (till the coming of Chriſt) by the Law and the Prophets; but was moſt perſpicuouſly and fully by Chriſt himſelf in his doctrine and death, and by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pouring out of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Howbeit all along and to this day every natural man is under a Covenant of Works, becauſe out of Chriſt, therefore under the Law, and the curſe of it; for which cauſe the Covenant of Works is by ſome called the <hi>Covenant of nature.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Faedus naturae.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, all they which look for righteouſneſſe and ſalvation by the power of their wills, by the ſtrength of nature, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties, as <hi>Jews, Turks, Philoſophers, Papiſts, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Pelagians,</hi> theſe are all under a Covenant of Works, they are not under grace; they are of <hi>Hagar</hi> the <hi>Bond-woman,</hi> of <hi>Mount Sinai which anſwers to Jeruſalem which now is, which is in bondage with her children,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in his elegant <hi>Allegory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to draw ſome Corollaries from this doctrine of the Covenant of Works thus propounded, in a practical way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and that briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 1. It ſerves for <hi>admiration,</hi> to wonder with a holy aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at the Lords infinite condeſcending love in making a Covenant with poor man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it was a free act in him to do it, he lay under no compulſion to it;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.15, 16.</note> nothing of merit or profit in a deſpicable worme appears as a motive to it; it was a royal act of glorious grace from the King of heaven to vile creatures: O wonderful!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe as it was free for him to do it, ſo he bound his hands by it, and as it were loſt his freedome by it; for his truth holds him faſt to it,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.18.</note> by which <hi>its impoſſible for him to change.</hi> O wonderful!</p>
            <p n="3">3. He made the firſt offer, he prevented us by his grace, <hi>he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 John 4.10, 19. all this appeared in the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us,<note place="margin">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119240:70"/> vel dignis laudibus evehere poſſit.</hi> Unſpeakable mercy that the eternal God ſhould firſt offer to league with us, moved to it by no merit in us, but by his own native goodneſſe only; a myſtery which the minde of man cannot conceive, nor his tongue praiſe to the worth of it; thus <hi>a grave Authour,</hi> which will the more inhance the love of God; if we</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider that he makes Covenant upon Covenant after breaches and forfeitures, renews them again, and ratifies them ſtronger than ever, as he did the new Covenant after the old was broken by our high and hainous provocation in the fall; and which he doth to every elect ſoul in the Sacraments, and after groſſe and grievous Apoſtaſies; See <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.60, 61, 62, 63. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. O admire and adore this love!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 2. Seeing there are two Covenants on foot, one of Works, another of grace; and very many, yea, the farre greateſt part of the world are under a Covenant of Works, which is a moſt ſad and doleful eſtate, becauſe a ſtate of wrath and death, a moſt wretched and accurſed condition; O try under what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thou art; for if thou art in the ſtate of ſinful nature, a ſprowt of old <hi>Adam,</hi> never yet cut off from his root of bitterneſſe, nor graffed into Chriſt, thou art undone; to be under ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is to be an enemy to God, and to be lyable to all his plagues; O make haſte then, <hi>and flee as a Post, and as the young Roe into Christs Armes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For conſider, how thou canſt ſtand before the Bar of God in thy ſins, in thy nakedneſſe; <hi>Adam</hi> fled away from the preſence of God afraid and aſhamed, hiding himſelf in the Thicket, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was naked; but where wilt thou hide thy nakedneſſe in that dreadful day of the Lord! there will be no ſhelter in that day for a ſinner:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 3. Labour to underſtand and diſcern aright the nature, tenour and termes of both Covenants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are eaſiiy miſtaken, and many do miſtake them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the miſtake is dangerous, like a man in the dark as he travels, findes two wayes; one way is wrong,<note place="margin">Prov. 14.12.</note> yet it ſeems as good and ſafe as the other; he goes on in the wrong, which leads him to a Rock, where he falls down headlong, and breaks his neck; ſo many a poor ſoul imagines he is under a Covenant of Grace,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119240:71"/> and in a ſafe way to heaven, when alas he is yet under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and in the high-way to hell; Labour then to diſcern the difference, ſearch Scriptures, and thy own heart, go to the Lord by prayer,<note place="margin">Job 33.23.</note> and to his M niſters, that they may ſhew thee thy way, leſt thou go on to thy deſtruction. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 4. Improve the Covenant of works for the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, righteouſneſs, and judgement; for till the Lord lets thee ſee what it is to be under ſuch a ſtate, thou wilt never ſee the evil of it, nor ever deſire to change it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 5. Renounce thy Covenants with <hi>ſin, Satan,</hi> and <hi>creatures,</hi> or elſe thou wilt never be admitted into Covenant with God; if thou break not with them, God will never cloſe with thee; if thou be a Covenant-ſervant to them, thou art no Covenant-ſervant of the Lords; for how canſt thou ſerve thoſe <hi>two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi>

               <hi>God and Mammon?</hi> both which crave thy whole man, and thy whole work, and which are utterly inconſiſtent with each other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 6. Labour to relieve thy ſelf under thy greateſt ſtraits and ſears by Covenant promiſes; I mean the promiſes of the new Covenant which are called <hi>better promiſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 8.6, 10, 11, 12. Joh. 15.</note> becauſe <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As the new Covenant is the <hi>beſt Covenant,</hi> and the promiſes of it the <hi>beſt promiſes,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 7. Bleſſe the Lord that ye are under the beſt diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cleareſt diſcovery of the Covenant of grace, better than <hi>Adams</hi> after the promiſe was made to him upon his fall; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Noahs</hi> after the flood, better than <hi>Iſraels</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, yea, better than the Patriarchs and Prophets who had much legality and obſcurity in their adminiſtrations, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of us who <hi>behold with open face the glory of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18.</p>
            <p>That it is the lot of us Gentiles to be brought into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and participation of the Goſpel in the laſt and beſt time; I mean after Chriſts appearance in the fleſh.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:119240:71"/>
            <p>The Apoſtle compares the Church to <hi>a Tree,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.16, 17.</note> which hath the ſame root Chriſt, but ſeveral branches; now that the natural branches ſhould be cut off to make way for the ingrafting of us wildings,<note place="margin">Pet.

            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 8. Labour for a ſpirit of ſelf-denial and debaſement; for as the Old Covenant ſpirit is a ſpirit of pride and boaſting to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance natural abilities,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.27. Rom. 10.3.</note> to glory in our own perſonal endowments and performances; ſo a New Covenant ſpirit is contrary to that, and is a ſpirit of faith, ſelf-denial and debaſement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 9. Watch againſt Satan; as ſoon as ever God and man were in Covenant, he ſet himſelf to break that Covenant, and prevailed; for he beguiled their ſimplicity by his ſubtilty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now albeit the New Covenant ſtands on a ſurer foundation, yet he will very much weaken our comforts, and increaſe our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows by drawing us under Gods diſpleaſure by ſin, forfeiting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant mercies by Covenant breaches, which mercies though they are not loſt finally to Gods Elect, yet are they often to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, renewed and ſecured to our ſouls by a clear evidence.</p>
            <p>Beſides Satan will perſwade men to ſlight and renounce their Baptiſme, as when he makes <hi>Witches,</hi> and turns Chriſtians to be <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> becauſe thereby he knows they renounce their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God to make one with himſelf; there are that upon fairer pretences, neglect or deny the Seals of the Covenant; Satan had a fair pretence alſo to draw away our firſt Parents, and make them break with God, which they little thought would have coſt ſo dear; but the ſad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſhewed the ſinfulneſſe of that ſinne; wherefore <hi>Wa ch and pray that ye enter not into temptation;</hi> Be not <hi>ignorant of Satans Devices</hi> in theſe back-ſliding and fedifragous times, <hi>Remember from whence ye are fallen,</hi> and walk <hi>ſtedfaſt in Gods Covenant; you that ſtand,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. To ſhew the excellency of Chriſt, and grace by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The neceſſity of faith in Chriſt; and both theſe he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates by a full and large compariſon between the firſt and the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> the loſſe by the firſt, the gain by the ſecond; the ſin of the firſt, the grace of the ſecond; the condemnation we are obliged in by the firſt, and the pardon we are enriched with by the ſecond, the firſt is a poyſonous ſpring, the ſecond is a cleanſing fountain.</p>
            <p>The Text, if you look at the deſign of it, it points at the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, where ſin and death firſt entered the world; and that was by <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden fruit; the prohibited Apple, was the firſt Apple of contention between God and man-kind. If we look at the parts of the Text, they are three.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:119240:73"/>1. We have an unhappy Parent, <hi>viz. Adam;</hi> not only by his offence undoing himſelf, but making a bankrupt world. By him ſin entered the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Text we have an unhappy poſterity, not only to be linkt to the loynes, but the ſins of the firſt Parent. The whole world had ſin entered into it, and all have ſinned, ſaith the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have an unhappy portion; ſin and death the inſeparable twins of miſery; ſo ſaith the Text, ſin enters, and death by ſin; ſin came by <hi>Adam,</hi> and death came by ſin; the one fell in pell mell into the world with the other; and both are the unhappy inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of every child of <hi>Adam;</hi> indeed the Saints are exempted from the ſecond, but not the firſt death; ſin and death were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in <hi>Adam,</hi> and they ſhall not be divorced in any of the ſons of <hi>Adam;</hi> believers dye temporally, though not eternally; they feel the ſtroak, though not the ſting of death.</p>
            <p>Now for the further clearing of my way, it will not be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, to take off the veile from the Text in a ſhort explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By one man]</hi> and him we may conſider; 1. His name, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and this comprehends his perſon, ſex, and kind. 2. His order; he was the firſt man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. 3. His perſon in the individual. And ſo Original ſin properly is not derived from the proximate Parents, but the prime-parent. 4. His nature; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was one, <hi>non tantum in individuo, ſed in ſpecie;</hi> one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the whole root, repreſenting the whole ſtock, the ſeed and generation of man-kind; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> is taken for the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of man.</p>

               <hi>viz. Our old man, the body of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>ſinne,</hi> all which ſignifie one and the ſame thing; that is, they all are put here to expreſſe our <hi>Original pravity,</hi> and <hi>inbred corruption.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Original pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity inhering in us, ſpoken to in the general.</note>And in the handling of this ſubject, give me leave to propound ſome things firſt more <hi>generally,</hi> (remembring that this diſcourſe is intended partly in the nature of a <hi>common place,</hi>) and then I ſhall ſpeak to it more <hi>particularly</hi> from the words now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Conſidered firſt, that there is ſuch a pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note>That which <hi>more generally</hi> I am to ſpeak unto, is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That there is a <hi>pravity, naughtineſſe,</hi> and corruption in every one.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What this <hi>corruption, and spiritual pravity is</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:119240:80"/>1. That there is ſuch a pravity, will partly appear from the forced conſent and common experience of all men.<note place="margin">Arguments to prove it.</note> To prove which I need not quote thoſe paſſages which <hi>Austin</hi> hath formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved out of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> or adde any other; for certainly the wickedneſſe man naturally tends unto is ſo groſſe,<note place="margin">Contra Julian. <hi>Pelag.</hi>
               </note> that the dim ſight of nature may eaſily diſcover it; were <hi>this</hi> to be read of Pagans, I would confirme my aſſertion as <hi>Paul</hi> did his, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. Certain <hi>of your own Poets have ſaid it:</hi> But I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I have to do with Chriſtians, and therefore to <hi>the Law and to the Testimony.</hi> Alas, theſe poor men, like thoſe that admired <hi>Nilus</hi>'s ſtreams, but were ignorant of its ſpring-head, they could not ſee ſo far as to the true cauſe of all this <hi>ſinful miſery;</hi> they could complain that none were content with their condition; but <hi>qui fit,</hi> how, or whence it came ſo to paſſe, they could not tell.</p>
            <p>Nay more, the wiſeſt Heathen with the plummet of reaſon could never fathom the depth of this corruption: St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> till a Convert, and ſavingly inſtructed <hi>in the Law,</hi> did not know <hi>this luſt.</hi> And this I the rather premiſe, becauſe I ſhall take my ſelf tyed up to Scripture-evidence and proofs in the buſineſſe in hand. Scripture makes only a full diſcovery of <hi>this diſeaſe,</hi> and of its <hi>cure</hi> too. Here only <hi>invenitur venenum,</hi> here only <hi>naſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur antidotus.</hi> Hence then I ſhall chiefly fetch theſe Arguments inſtead of many.</p>
            <p>The firſt Argument of our ſinful condition by nature may be taken from <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. where 'tis ſaid that <hi>Adam</hi> who had been created in <hi>the likeneſſe of God,</hi> ver. 1. after his fall by ſin,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.

Now what is it for God to create man in <hi>his likeneſſe?</hi> 'tis <hi>ſanctus ſanctum.</hi> A holy God creared man holy; and by conſequence for <hi>Adam</hi> to beget <hi>Seth</hi> in <hi>his likeneſſe,</hi> is <hi>corruptus corruptum;</hi> defiled <hi>Adam</hi> begat defiled, polluted <hi>Seth;</hi> and indeed who can bring a clean thing out of that which is unclean?<note place="margin">John 14.4.</note> if the root be corrupt, the fruit is not ſound; if the fountain be poyſon'd, the waters are not wholeſome; if the Parents be leprous, or infected with ſome other diſeaſe not to be named, they entail their malady as well as their nature upon their unhappy off-ſpring. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can exceed the vertue of its cauſe, which is the ground
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119240:81"/> of our Saviours aſſertion, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very remarkable that the like phraſe is not uſed when Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of <hi>Adams</hi> begetting <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Abel,</hi> (though both theſe were begotten in <hi>Adams</hi> likeneſſe too) becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dye without iſſue, and all <hi>Cains</hi> progeny to be drowned by the flood, it is noted the rather of <hi>Seth</hi> by whom all mankind hath hitherto been continued in the world; that he, (from whom as well as from <hi>Adam</hi> we all came) was begat in <hi>Adams own</hi> image, that into which by ſin he had transformed himſelf; and not in that likeneſſe which was Gods, in which God at firſt made him.</p>
            <p>Nay, though the Parents be regenerated, yet their children by nature are altogether defiled; becauſe they beget children as they are men, not as they are holy men; though the Parent be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, the childe brings into the world an uncircumciſed foreskin with it, as the pureſt wheat that is caſt into the Field comes up with husks and ſtalks. I might adde that the holieſt men upon earth, are but holy in part, they have a dark ſide as well as a light ſide, and <hi>proles</hi> (as <hi>concluſio) ſequitur deteriorem partem;</hi> their children are like to what they were by nature, and cannot without the ſame Almighty mercy be like what they are through grace, witneſſe <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s children; but there are too many ſad Evidences of this amongſt us daily.</p>

            <p>This ſin appeares in the <hi>mind,</hi> the eye of the ſoul; <hi>'tis dim-ſighted in natural things; 'tis quite out as to spiritual truths.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.</hi> What thoſe things of the Spirit are, the Context tells us, no other than the plaineſt truths of the Goſpel; nay, he counts theſe fooliſhneſſe. Thoſe things which are the <hi>wiſdome of God,</hi> the product of infinite wiſdome, he ſlights and diſeſteems; and no wonder, for <hi>he cannot know them, becauſe they are spiritually diſcerned.</hi> Spiritual truths as ſuch, are no more within the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the <hi>natural</hi> eye of the ſoul, than ſpiritual ſubſtances are within the view of the eye of the body. <hi>There is none that

            </p>
            <p>And hence it is that in our ſpiritual recovery the eyes are anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with eye-ſalve. Chriſt came to <hi>open the eyes of the blinde;</hi> and his Spirit is a Spirit of <hi>illumination</hi> and <hi>revelation:</hi>

               <note place="margin">2. The will is perverted with it.</note> it hath not ſeized only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head, but upon the heart. <hi>The imagination of the thought of mans heart is evil, and only evil,</hi> Gen. 6.5. &amp; Gen. 21.17. Jer. 9. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear gloſſing upon thoſe places; hence it is that there is ſo little love unto, or deſire after heavenly things; can any man give a reaſon (which he will not be aſhamed of at that great day) why he loves God no more? <hi>What iniquity have ye found in me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Non amo — nec poſſum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere quare.</note> ſays the Lord.</p>
            <p>As the Elements have their proper principles of motion, <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and levity,</hi> whereby they tend to that place in the Univerſe that beſt ſuits them; and ſenſitive creatures have their wings or feet to carry them towards thoſe objects which are moſt convenient for them; ſo God hath endued rational creatures with <hi>a will and affections</hi> to carry them forth towards the enjoying of himſelf who only is the Center of their happineſſe, and without whom they can never be at reſt.</p>
            <p>But does the will of man by nature do him this good office to carry him unto God as his only bliſſe? why then do we ſee and hear of ſo many that are in the ſearch of other things, not once to be named with God? how many are there of whom it may be ſaid, God was never thus to be ſure in all their thoughts! like the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites they are ſcattered up and down gathering ſtraw; nay, droſſe and dung in the Apoſtles ſenſe, is frequently preferr'd before Jeſus

How many may ſadly ſay as that good man, <hi>Quantum Mercator pro lucro, &amp;c.</hi> I have not done ſo much for my God, as the Merchant doth daily for his gain, or the Hunts-man for his game: and yet what gain or pleaſure is comparable to our enjoying of, and communion with God? but further,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. The body is not free from it.</note>The body bears a part with the ſoul in this ſore evil; 'tis compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively I confeſſe but a ſmall part, for it can according to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bear no greater.</p>
            <p>Our Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſinne <hi>reigning in our body,</hi> Rom. 6.12. Every member of our body is ready to act in a ſinne; <hi>to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>a ſervant to uncleanneſs,</hi> ver. 19. The temper or rather diſtemper of the body enclining often, ſometimes to one, ſometimes to another ſinne, which the Divel (who is beſt ſeen in our conſtitutions) makes much uſe of in ſuiting his temptations; hence he frequently tempts thoſe that are melancholy to deſpair, and the ſanguine he tempts to preſume, with no ſmall diſadvantage to their ſouls from the ſeveral inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their bodies.</p>
            <p>To be ſure, whil'ſt a man is or ſhould be providing for his ſoul, the body too often interrupts him with <hi>What ſhall I eat? what ſhall I drink? wherewith ſhall I be cloathed?</hi> And if there be any fear of ſuffering, though for Chriſt and his Goſpel, the body cryes <hi>Spare thy ſelf, this may not come unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> So that with <hi>Adam</hi> by reaſon of ſinne we need a cloathing for, and may be aſham'd of our very bodies. Even they alſo ſhould be the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but are now become Cages for theſe unclean Birds.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19.</note>

            <p>We do not read that <hi>Adam</hi> after the commiſſion of his ſin, did ſo much as once think of God, till he <hi>heard the voice of the Lord, walking in the garden</hi> in the cool of the day, in order to the calling of him to an account for his ſin, and then he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and flies, &amp;c.

            <p>Now whither theſe faculties of ſoul and body being ſo nearly conjoyned, do corrupt and infect one another; as Ivy while cleaving to the Oak, draws away the ſap from it, and deſtroyes it, I ſhall not here contend; I confeſſe there are many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerning this ſubject, of which we may ſay, as of other depths in Religion, with the Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, John</hi> 4.25. <hi>When the Meſſias comes, he will teach us all things.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. It may be call'd <hi>Old,</hi> becauſe of its cunning and craft; as old men by reaſon of their abundant experience, are more wiſe and ſubtle than others.

            <p>Now Original corruption is a <hi>body</hi> of ſin,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Why called a body.</note>1. In that a <hi>body,</hi> though it ſeems never ſo beautiful and fair, yet 'tis in it ſelf but a ſtinking carcaſſe, made of baſe, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

            <p n="2">2. As a <hi>body</hi> being material, is viſible; ſo <hi>original ſin</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers its ſelf to every one that without prejudice will look to finde it.

And on the other ſide that ſin is a <hi>body,</hi> and is thus univerſally in us, the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13, 14. and the Prophet ſaith it hath over-ſpread us; from the ſoles of the feet even unto the head there is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.6.

            <p>And this is farre more ſad than to be poſſeſſed, or to have our members acted by the <hi>Divel</hi> himſelf; for the inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was given over to Satan (which ſome interpret thus) for the good of his ſoul,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.5.</note> that his ſoul might be ſaved; but none are left under the power and command of their corruptions, but to their certain and inevitable deſtruction.</p>

To blot a letter in a fairly writ Copy, to draw a black line over a beautiful picture, cann't but prove a fault; what is it then to mar Gods curious workmanſhip, which this ſin does in man?

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>wrath</hi> in the Scriptures hath ſeveral Names; reſpectively to the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> it is called <hi>wrath;</hi> reſpectively to <hi>the Law it ſelf, the curſe;</hi> reſpectively to the <hi>effects of both,</hi> it is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>vengeance,</hi> Rom. 3.5.

Perturbation; the wrath of men is the rage of men, who disjoint and diſcompoſe themſelves as well as others; but the Lord <hi>acts,</hi> and ſuffers not in his wrath;<note place="margin">Prov. 11.17.</note> he ſtrikes, wounds, deſtroys from the infinite holineſſe and juſtice of his nature, declaring it ſelf againſt all ſin with the exacteſt ſerenity and <hi>oneneſs</hi> of minde and frame within himſelf from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider what this wrath implies; two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Lord is <hi>highly diſpleaſed with</hi> men and women in their natural eſtate; though never ſo goodly a verniſh of Religion be <hi>above,</hi> yet if nothing but nature be <hi>underneath;</hi> Iſa. 10.6. an <hi>hypocritical Nation are the people of the Lords wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No created underſtanding can conceive exactly what this diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thy anger? even according to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath.</hi> Take ſome <hi>ſhort ladders</hi> that our thoughts may a little <hi>climbe up</hi> by; and conſider ſeriouſly and deeply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What a <hi>Kings wrath</hi> is. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.2. <hi>The fear of a King is as the roaring of a Lyon; who ſo provoketh him to anger, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt his own ſoul;</hi> that is, acteth as an enemy to his <hi>own life;</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.14. <hi>The wrath of a King is as the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of death, but the wiſe man will pacifie it,</hi> as that which he cannot reſiſt. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Where the Word of a King is, there
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119240:94"/> is power, and who may ſay to him What do thou?</hi> that is, where not only the <hi>name,</hi> but the reality of a King is, he ſuſtains the perſon of the Common-wealth, and hath the ſtrength and power of all put into his hand; and hath power to execute his wrath, and will not be controlled nor expoſtulated with. And what can a Branch do againſt the whole Tree? The King is <hi>wroth,</hi> and <hi>Hamans</hi> face is covered. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.3. <hi>A stone is heavy, and ſand is weighty; but a fools wrath,</hi> that is, that hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>is heavier than them both,</hi> to cruſh a weak perſon that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in his way. All theſe are but <hi>toyes</hi> to the power and weight of Gods wrath.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What an <hi>incenſed brothers</hi> wrath is, that hath a little more power. <hi>Rebecca</hi> underſtanding <hi>Eſau</hi> his wrath againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> packs him away till that wrath be over. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.43, 44. If a <hi>mother</hi> dare not venture a childe into an angry <hi>ſons</hi> preſence, nor a <hi>brother himſelf</hi> into an angry <hi>brothers</hi> preſence, how inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable will the <hi>angry preſence of the Lord</hi> be?</p>
            <p n="3">3. What Gods <hi>Fatherly refining</hi> wrath is againſt the droſſe that mingleth it ſelf with his Worſhip and Ordinances, and what dreadful Furnaces he hath put the <hi>Veſſels of mercy</hi> into, to take away their tin from them. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a Refiners fire:</hi> If men cannot bear Chriſts coming with a <hi>refining fire,</hi> to purge out droſſe, much leſſe not his coming <hi>with flaming fire,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. to <hi>conſume</hi> and burn up perſons and droſſe together. <hi>We have need of grace to ſerve him acceptably with reverence and godly fear; for our God,</hi> that is related to us in Chriſt, <hi>is a conſuming fire,</hi> Hebr. 12.28, 29.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What <hi>afflictions</hi> are, how very bitter, yet ſeparated from wrath, they may be born with comfort. The mingling of fire with the haile in <hi>Egypt,</hi> made it ſo very dreadful, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.24. The fire of the Lords <hi>wrath</hi> mingled with ſtormes, renders them ſo grievous to be ſtood unde. Hell it ſelf would not be ſo dreadful, did not the <hi>breath of the Lord,</hi> that is, the wrath of the Lord, <hi>like a ſtreame of brimſtone kindle it, Iſa.</hi> 30.33.</p>
            <p>The Prophet ſubmits to any ſtroaks, only deprecates <hi>wrath,</hi> as worſe than any ſtroaks, and more deadly than death it ſelf. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Correct me O Lord, but not in thine anger.</hi> Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of wrath were the dregs in <hi>Jobs</hi> Cup. <hi>Job</hi> 14.13. <hi>O

            <p>And underſtand, when the Lord ſo deals with this ſort of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he takes a kind of <hi>comfort</hi> in it. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Thus my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhall be accompliſhed, and I will cauſe my fury to reſt upon them, and I will be comforted.</hi> To <hi>others,</hi> the Lord diſtributes ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows <hi>with ſorrow;</hi> and ſpeaks of himſelf as <hi>grieved,</hi> when he puts <hi>them to grief,</hi> Judg. 10.16.

The Word,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Rings many a ſad <hi>peale</hi> in the ears of conſcience, and which he cannot abde to hear or think of; in that it doth declare,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His ſinne;</hi> The Word faithfully diſovers <hi>Gods ſtreightneſs,</hi> and <hi>mans crookedneſs,</hi> and ſwervings from that platforme and rule, to which he ſhould be conformed as the Counter-part to the Original.

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>due and deſert of ſinne;</hi> every breaker of the Law, the Law pronounces and dooms to be curſed. There is <hi>that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connexion,</hi> that it is impoſſible to be chargeable with ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law, and not liable to the Curſe of the Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in every thing that is written in the Book of the Law, to do it. Juſtification it ſelf</hi> takes not away the deſert of ſin; pardoned ſins are as <hi>well</hi> ſins, and as much ſins as they were; pardon makes not the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour none; makes not that the <hi>fact</hi> was not <hi>committed,</hi> or not <hi>faulty,</hi> or that it <hi>deſerved not</hi> death; for then he ſhould have been <hi>legally</hi> acquitted, not <hi>graciouſly</hi> pardoned. Thoſe will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take heaven of grace, that take not hell as their proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. The Lord will have <hi>his own</hi> weare this rope about their necks, the deſert of hell in their hearts to the very grave. <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,</hi> and in the very higheſt <hi>degree,</hi> takes not away the ſenſe of the deſerts of ſin, but amplifies and enlarges them. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of ſin ſhall be perfectly acknowledged in the <hi>ſtate of glory,</hi> and the Ranſomer adored and admired upon this ſcore. Nothing ſo heightens grace as this, that perſons <hi>deſerving to</hi> ſuffer, are yet freed in Chriſt from ſuffering <hi>eternal wrath,</hi> as if they had <hi>not deſerved it.</hi> This deſert, was no <hi>doubtful and dark point</hi> in the conſciences of the Hearthens themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. They know the judgement of God, that they which commit ſuch things, are worthy of death.</hi> But the Word <hi>more diſtinctly</hi> layes this home to the heart; <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.23. <hi>The expectation of the wicked is wrath.</hi> There is nothing elſe that he can <hi>juſtly and ſolidly</hi> expect <hi>in that eſtate;</hi> and expecting otherwiſe, he does but <hi>cozen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                  </gap>s of the Goſpel.</hi> The Word opens the promiſes, but knocks his fingers off from touching and eating of this <hi>Tree of life.</hi> This is none of the meaneſt heart-cutting ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to natural men, to <hi>ſee many come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſit down with Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, and themſelves caſt out,</hi> Mat. 8.11, 12. incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated with the Patriarchs, into <hi>fellowſhip</hi> of the ſame grace, and <hi>title</hi> to the ſame glory, and themſelves debarred from both to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119240:96"/> view the unſearchable riches of Chriſt diſplayed, and themſelves <hi>juſtled</hi> off from any intermedling, as to preſent application or grounds of application of them as <hi>their own.</hi> I met lately with a godly woman who heard a Sermon full of choice comforting ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting promiſes to <hi>weary and heavy laden</hi> ſinners, which warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her heart, but in the cloſure was ſtrucken through with the firſt arrows of God, diſcerning her ſelf excluded <hi>in her preſent eſtate,</hi> from any part in them. This makes the Goſpel a <hi>fiery Serpent</hi> to ſting them, which is the <hi>Pole</hi> holding up the brazen Serpent for healing to others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Word attaches and binds him over. Ye ſhall anſwer this at the day of Chriſt; and hangs the writ upon his door; as the man that is in Gods debt, and is to look for an Arreſt, and to be dragged into priſon till the utmoſt farthing be paid, unleſſe a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, timely peace be made; and inforces this partly <hi>from the will and juſtice of God,</hi> that hath made <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and anguiſh</hi> the portion of <hi>every ſoul</hi> that goeth on to <hi>do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> Rom. 2.8.9. and partly <hi>from the nature and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſin it ſelf.</hi> Debts may be ſo great, ſo long owing, ſo growing, and the negligence and boldneſſe of the debtor ſuch, that makes it neceſſary in point of <hi>wiſdome,</hi> not to keep the writ longer off from his back.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Word excites terrours. A man bound in a very great ſumme, in which the forfeiture will be his undoing, the <hi>very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation troubles.</hi> There are no debts, but where any ingenuity is, induce anſwerable cares. And the Lord <hi>knowing the frame, and tendring the peace</hi> of his people, <hi>adviſes</hi> therefore againſt all debts, eſpecially ſticking under them, and not coming <hi>timely and carefully</hi> off. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Owe nothing unto any man;</hi> much more to be <hi>over head and eares in Gods debt,</hi> and no care to <hi>agree with him,</hi> is a very dreadful condition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. If theſe terrours <hi>actually</hi> are not, yet they are very <hi>ſubject</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment to be excited. The Sea may be very calme, but the leaſt ſtorme makes it nothing but commotions; conſcience, though now quiet, hath a very wide and clamorous mouth, when the Lord commiſſions and commands it to rebuke for ſin. Theſe terrours <hi>hold</hi> the ſinner in bondage, or <hi>all his life time ſubject unto bondage,</hi> Heb. 2.15.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:119240:97"/>
            <p>This is the ſecond branch of the miſery of a natural eſtate, to be in all theſe reſpects under the <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> and to have the <hi>Lord fight againſt him with the ſword of his mouth,</hi> Revel. 2.16. Here is <hi>patience,</hi> that the Lord will fight with this ſword <hi>firſt,</hi> that he may <hi>reclaime</hi> and lead to repentance, rather than deſtroy him; and if this prevaile, then is the <hi>curſe</hi> turned into a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> and the <hi>bondage</hi> ends in <hi>liberty indeed;</hi> but if this do not prevaile, then <hi>there remains</hi> nothing elſe <hi>but a certain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which ſhall devoure the adverſaries,</hi> Heb. 10.27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every natural man and woman is obnoxious to <hi>all the effects</hi> of the wrath of God, and of the curſes denounced in his Word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are manifold effects of Gods wrath that are upon him, or are apt every moment to be ruſhing in upon him <hi>in this life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon <hi>the body:</hi> Look upon all the <hi>breaches, flawes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, monſtroſities</hi> in the body, and ſet them upon the ſcore of ſin. Every man elſe had been like <hi>Abſalom</hi> and much more. 2 Sam. 14.25. <hi>From the ſole of his foot even to the Crown of his head there was no blemiſh in him;</hi> theſe argue not ſpecial ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.2. yet had never been without ſin; look upon all <hi>diſeaſes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or adventitious,</hi> John 5.14. <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee;</hi> there had never been a ſtone in the <hi>reins,</hi> or in the <hi>bladder,</hi> if not firſt in the <hi>heart.</hi> Theſe crumblings <hi>by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> into the duſt, flow in by ſin. We pity the ruines which <hi>War</hi> hath made in goodly Palaces, but thoſe are nothing to the havock which <hi>ſin</hi> hath made in the <hi>more noble Fabricks</hi> of our own bodies. Look upon the <hi>difficulties, cares, turmoyles</hi> for proviſion of us and ours. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. Labour is with toyle, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, vexation, diſappointment: We plough and ſowe, and reap not; <hi>earne and put in a bag with holes.</hi> Hag. 1.6. Look <hi>upon ſhameful nakedneſſe:</hi> We have loſt our Robes of glory, and need <hi>now</hi> the ſpoiles of beaſts to cover our ſhame with. How many trades are there, and what toile in them, <hi>meerly</hi> for this end, that the diſhonour of the body may be hidden! Look upon the <hi>ſorrows of the female ſex,</hi> Gen. 3.16. which though miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and mingled with promiſes, yet ſtill are arrows which ſin hath ſhot into their ſides, and grace doth not quite pluck them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119240:97"/> forth. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. Look upon the <hi>aſſaults made even to our ruine, by thoſe things that otherwiſe were under our feet,</hi> Pſal. 8.6. But now withdraw from the yoke, ſerve with groans, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsneſſe and much unſerviceableneſſe, and often lift up their heel, and turn and tear us; theſe are a very ſmall part, and only bare hints of thoſe confuſions, and effects of the Lords wrath, which ſin hath let into the body, which elſe had been invulnerable in the very heel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Upon the ſoul; Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>minde:</hi> O what <hi>blindneſs,</hi> ignorance, thick darkneſſe in the apprehenſions of God, his very being, moſt ſelf-evidencing Attributes, in the very myſteries of the firſt magnitude, which are the rules of our duty, and the grounds of our hope! <hi>incapableneſs,</hi> dulneſſe, ſlowneſſe to believe; <hi>lothneſs</hi> to <hi>inquire</hi> or <hi>receive</hi> the light which ſhineth forth from heaven; <hi>doubts,</hi> diſtruſt, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, wandrings after that which is not light, and into <hi>wayes that ſeem right, but the end of them are the ways of death,</hi> Prov. 14.12. The hereſies of the whole earth are <hi>ſeminally</hi> in the blindneſſe of the minde, and would grow up from thence, though there were none of our <hi>many ſowers</hi> to ſcatter them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing elſe but <hi>corrupt imaginations</hi> formed into a ſyſteme. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitableneſſe</hi> in the knowledge of truths, which we moſt <hi>clearly and diſtinctly</hi> conceive: <hi>Unſteadineſſe,</hi> that we cannot fix and cloſe upon holy thoughts, till the impreſſions thence be powerful, and work a real change. There is no <hi>Spaniel more wilde</hi> and running after every <hi>Lark and Butter-flye</hi> that riſes in his way, than our thoughts are <hi>gadding</hi> after every thing that comes in our way. Yea, our minde <hi>gathers</hi> vanity to it ſelf, when the eyes are ſhut, and no objects to divert and inveigle us with. Theſe are ſins, and yet are ruſhing in <hi>further,</hi> as the <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences</hi> of former ſins, which <hi>are meet,</hi> Rom. 1.27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>memory:</hi> Things <hi>ſtick</hi> there that a man would <hi>gladly learn,</hi> and count it a ſingular mercy to <hi>attain</hi> the art of forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of; and others <hi>leak and ſlip away</hi> though taught ofen plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; repeated, muſed upon, and we felt the power of them <hi>in a degree</hi> upon our hearts; what <hi>Indiſpoſitions to the uſe of means in order to a cure?</hi> what <hi>Proneneſs to cumber our ſelves with by-matters,</hi> till they talk with us ſleeping, and crowd in and ſuck away <hi>Lords-days</hi> themſelves, and leave nothing but <hi>ſcraps</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Conſcience. <hi>The directing part is out of tune;</hi> and either gives <hi>no directions,</hi> as a Maſter that is no body in his Family; or gives <hi>wrong directions,</hi> as falſe lights on the ſhore lead the ſhips upon the Rocks and quickſands; forbids where the Lord commands, and urges to that which he forbids. <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. or gives <hi>right directions, and hath no authority.</hi> And <hi>the judging part of conſcience is out of tune,</hi> and gives <hi>no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what is done;</hi> like a <hi>Bell</hi> whoſe clapper is out, or a <hi>dumb dog</hi> that cannot bark; or gives <hi>perverſe judgement,</hi> and <hi>excuſes where it ſhould accuſe;</hi> makes ſin no ſin, or very little; and ſtayes the heart with empty comforts; or <hi>accuſes for having done that which he is bound to do,</hi> and diſquiets with undue fears; or <hi>accuſes rightly for the matter, yet with exceſſe,</hi> and ſo ſinks the ſoul under deſpaire; ſo that <hi>there is as much need for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be overſeen as to overſee, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. The Will. There are ſad ſtrokes there. <hi>Averſeneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence unto that which is spiritually good,</hi> Phil. 2.13. Pſal. 110.4. <hi>Inclinations and byaſſes,</hi> to drink in the very <hi>firſt,</hi> and the very <hi>worſt</hi> motions and ſuggeſtions unto ſin. <hi>Luſtings after evil things,</hi> Job 15.16. and <hi>againſt the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>Contempt of the offers of reconciliation,</hi> Joh. 5.40.

            <p n="5">5.

               <note place="margin">Pſal 81.12. Pſal. 78.30.</note> Theſe are hints, and no more of the Lords wrath upon the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon the eſtate. Look upon the <hi>general estate of the whole Creation,</hi> impaired, groaning, and ſubject unto vanity; into the <hi>Publick ſtate,</hi> Confuſions, ſtumbling-blocks, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minings of civil and ſpiritual liberties, &amp;c. into the <hi>particular estates of</hi> men, ſnarles, damages, wrongs, powlings; men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and carried whither they would not, build, and dwell not therein, gather, and it melts as butter againſt the Sun, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Upon Relations. <hi>Unequal marriages,</hi> yokefellows diſloyal, waſtful, idle, with-holding more than is meet; troubling their own fleſh, dampers in the wayes of God, ſuddenly ſtrucken, and the greateſt comforts leave the ſmarteſt wounds after them, &amp;c. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithful ſervants</hi> looking only to the Maſters eye, invading that which is not theirs, imbezeling or ſuffering to go to wrack, that which by care they might and ought to preſerve. <hi>Children</hi> ſickly, unnatural, taking to no Callings, or not diligent and faithful in them, diſpoſe themſelves without conſent, run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into bryers, and ſee their errour when too late to retreat. This is wrath in <hi>Domeſtique</hi> relations. And wrath as terribly mixeth in <hi>Publick</hi> Relations. <hi>Miniſters</hi> preach not, overſee not, are not enſamples to the flock, have not experience, nor ability, or care, rightly to divide the Word of truth, and <hi>muzzle</hi> the gain-ſayer.

            <p n="3">3. Conſider the dreadful aggravations of ſin. It is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>confederacy with the devil.</hi> A ſworn ſervant about the Princes perſon, to contract amity, and hold correſpondence with the <hi>worſt</hi> of his enemies, makes the ſin <hi>riſe,</hi> and his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>without pity.</hi> Should a Chriſtian fall from a <hi>mild</hi> and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince <hi>without a cauſe,</hi> and ſide with the <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>worſhipper of the devil,</hi> againſt him, we ſhould think no puniſhment <hi>too much</hi> for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119240:103"/> there is an <hi>Action of battery</hi> and damages to be had againſt him; He that doth the ſame againſt the <hi>Judge of Aſſize,</hi> or the <hi>King upon the Throne,</hi> that is <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and his life and eſtate are hardly enough to make amends for it. The <hi>infinity of God,</hi> makes the infinity of the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>meritoriouſneſs</hi> of wrath in ſin.

Upon God himſelf. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.3. <hi>The fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord.</hi> The Malefactour blames the Judge, when it was <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> that <hi>delivered</hi> himſelf over into the Judges power, and <hi>Armed</hi> the Law with power of doing all that is done againſt him.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Who can dwell with this wrath which God deſcribes to be 1. <hi>Burning</hi> wrath; <hi>Job</hi> 19.11. <hi>He hath kindled his wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</hi> 2. <hi>Tearing</hi> wrath; this ſet the Bears awork, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.23. <hi>Conſider this yet that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Lie down meekly at the Lords feet; this follows upon the practice of the firſt direction. 1. In ſubmiſſion to any the ſharpeſt diſpenſations.

               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:119240:105"/>2.

            <p n="1">1. Ploughing carefully with the Lords heifer, <hi>viz. ſearch into the Oracles of God;</hi> there, and there only are <hi>lively portraitures</hi> of ſin, and the genuine products and traine of ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>eye-ſalve of the Spirit.</hi> We are blinder than Batts in this matter; and are indiſpoſed very much, or rather wholly, to let this truth ſink down into our hearts.</p>

            <p n="5">5.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119240:105"/> of ſin,</hi> but he ſhivered, and was like a <hi>garment eaten up of moths.</hi> This hath fretted the joynts of <hi>Kingdomes</hi> in pieces,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.11.</note> and made the goodlieſt <hi>houſes</hi> in the world a heap of rubbiſh;<note place="margin">Zech. 5.4.</note> will make <hi>Bab lon</hi> that ſits <hi>as a Queen,</hi> an <hi>habitation of Divels,</hi>

Never were the <hi>like changes</hi> made as by ſinne; <hi>grace</hi> makes not changes of <hi>richer comfort,</hi> than <hi>ſin</hi> doth of <hi>diſmal conſequence;</hi> it is made by the Holy Ghoſt an argument of the infinity of the power of God to <hi>pardon and ſubdue</hi> ſinne, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Bear all afflictions incident to an holy courſe chearfully.

            <p>The ſecond Compariſon is of the efficacy of the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> and the efficacy of the <hi>life of Chriſt;</hi> 'tis abſurd to think that Chriſt <hi>riſing</hi> from the dead, and <hi>living</hi> in heaven, ſhould not be as powerful <hi>to ſave,</hi> and bring us to God, as <hi>Chriſt dying</hi> was to <hi>reconcile</hi> us to him.</p>
            <p>The third Compariſon is the <hi>privative mercy,</hi> or being ſaved <hi>from hell,</hi> with the <hi>poſitive mercy,</hi> or obtaining a title to <hi>heaven.</hi> Verſe 11. and <hi>not only ſo, but we joy in God, as having now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the atonement.</hi>

Curſed <hi>in all that he doth;</hi> his <hi>prayer</hi> is turned into <hi>ſin;</hi> his <hi>hearing,</hi> the <hi>ſavour of death unto death;</hi> all his toyle and labour in outward ſervice is to no purpoſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.27. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</hi> At the beſt 'tis but an <hi>abomination,</hi> God will not accept an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at his hands, much more when 'tis <hi>pulluted with ſinful</hi> and <hi>evil aimes;</hi> but this is not all; he is <hi>curſed for evermore,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> bindeth him over <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> to <hi>everlaſting torments,</hi> and in time he ſhall hear that dreadful ſentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Go ye curſed into everlasting fire prepared for the Divel and his Angels;</hi> there is but the <hi>ſlender thread</hi> of a fraile life that hinders the execution of this ſentence upon him; a ſinner ſtands upon the very brink of hell, and ever and anon is ready to be caſt in, where he ſhall eternally lie under the wrath of God; ſo that here we are without ſtrength, becauſe we cannot ſatisfie the juſtice of God for one ſin, but are <hi>alwayes ſatisfying,</hi> and can never be ſaid to <hi>have ſatisfied;</hi> like a poor man that pays a debt of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds by a farthing a week.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>Firſt, Sometimes <hi>it terrifieth,</hi> that's eaſily done; the conſcience of a ſinner is a ſore place; they are <hi>all their life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> Hebr. 2.14. There is a <hi>hidden fear</hi> in the heart of a wicked man not <hi>alwayes felt,</hi> but <hi>ſoon awakened,</hi> either by a <hi>ſound

            <p>Secondly, If it <hi>terrifieth</hi> not the conſcience, it <hi>ſtupifieth</hi> the conſcience, that they grow ſenſleſſe of their miſery, <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> Epheſ. 4.19. and that's a dangerous <hi>Criſis</hi> and eſtate of ſoul, when once a man comes to that, and goeth like <hi>a fool to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſtocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, it irritateth their inbred corruption. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment came,</hi> that is, in full conviction and power, <hi>and ſin revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and I <hi>dyed;</hi> the more we underſtand of the <hi>neceſſity of our ſubjection</hi> to God, the <hi>more oppoſite</hi> is the ſoul to him; as <hi>a Damm</hi> makes <hi>a River</hi> or <hi>ſtrong ſtreame</hi> the more violent, or <hi>as a Bullock</hi> at the <hi>first yoking</hi> becometh the more <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or Fourthly, It breedeth a <hi>ſottiſh deſpaire.</hi> Jer. 18.12. <hi>There is no hope, therefore we will walk after our own devices, and do every one according to the evil imaginations of our own heart;</hi> 'tis to no purpoſe to ſpeak to us, or ſtrive further about us; (as if they had ſaid) there is <hi>no hope,</hi> and therefore we will live as we liſt without any further care of turning to God; this is the worſt kinde of deſpaire, when a man is<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 81.12.</note> 
               <hi>given up to his own hearts luſt,</hi> and runneth headlong in the way of deſtruction without hope of returning; there is more hope of them that are under <hi>despairing fears,</hi> or a <hi>terrified conſcience,</hi> than there is of thoſe which are under <hi>deſpairing reſolutions,</hi> or a <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>ſottiſh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy:</hi> thus as to the Law man is helpleſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider man as to <hi>terms of grace offered in the Gospel;</hi> he is ſtill <hi>without ſtrength,</hi> not only in a damnable condition by <hi>the Law,</hi> but without grace, <hi>unable</hi> to accept the <hi>Gospel;</hi> this will appear by two conſiderations.</p>

But is not the New Teſtament more favourable than the Old? or is not man grown better, ſince there was ſo much grace diſcovered! I anſwer, No; there is a <hi>perfect harmony</hi> between the Teſtaments; there you will finde man repreſented as a <hi>childe of wrath by nature,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. even the <hi>Elect</hi> as well <hi>as others,</hi> to be a <hi>ſervant of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.17. Never ſuch an <hi>imperious</hi> Maſter, never ſuch a <hi>willing ſervant;</hi> ſin never leaveth <hi>commanding,</hi> and we <hi>love</hi> the work; you will finde him again expreſſed as one averſe from God, <hi>alienated from his life,</hi> Epheſ. 4.18. 'Tis a melancholy thought to a carnal heart to think of <hi>the life of God,</hi> as <hi>an enemy to the Law,</hi> Rom. 8.7.

The next proof is from thoſe <hi>aſſertions,</hi> whereby all power is denied to man to convert himſelf to God, or to do any thing that is ſpiritually good; as when 'tis ſaid he <hi>cannot know,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. he <hi>cannot believe,</hi> Joh. 6.44. he <hi>cannot obey,</hi> Rom. 8.7. nay to inſtance in ſingle acts, he <hi>cannot think a good thought of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:119240:110"/> himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. he cannot <hi>ſpeak a good word,</hi> Mat. 12.34. <hi>How can ye, being evil, speak good things?</hi> he <hi>cannot do any thing, John</hi> 15.5. He doth not ſay, <hi>nihil magnum,</hi> but, <hi>nihil;</hi> not <hi>no great thing,</hi> but <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Well then, when man can neither <hi>know,</hi> nor <hi>believe,</hi> nor <hi>obey,</hi> nor <hi>think,</hi> nor <hi>speak,</hi> nor <hi>do</hi> any thing without grace; ſurely man is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength,</hi> wholly impotent and unable to turn himſelf to God.</p>
            <p>But here is an Objection; If it be ſo, how can theſe things ſtand with the <hi>mercy of God,</hi> as the <hi>Creatour</hi> of man kind, to require the <hi>debt</hi> of him that is not <hi>able</hi> to pay? with the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God as <hi>the Judge of the world,</hi> to <hi>puniſh</hi> him with <hi>eternal death,</hi> for the <hi>neglect</hi> of that which he <hi>could</hi> not performe? or with the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of the <hi>ſupreme law-giver,</hi> to <hi>exhort</hi> him by promiſes which hath no power, to do what he is exhorted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?</p>
            <p>I anſwer to the <hi>firſt;</hi> God doth not loſe <hi>his right,</hi> though man hath loſt <hi>his power;</hi> their <hi>impotency</hi> doth not diſſolve <hi>their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;</hi> a <hi>drunken ſervant</hi> is a <hi>ſervant,</hi> and 'tis againſt all reaſon the <hi>Maſter</hi> ſhould loſe his <hi>right to command</hi> by the <hi>ſervants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault;</hi> a <hi>Prodigal debtour</hi> that hath nothing to pay, yet is liable to be ſued for the debt without any injuſtice; God contracted with us <hi>in Adam;</hi> and that obedience he requireth is not only due by <hi>Covenant,</hi> but by <hi>Law;</hi> not only by <hi>poſitive Law,</hi> and <hi>contract,</hi> but by <hi>immutable right;</hi> 'tis harſh men think to ſuffer for <hi>Adams fault,</hi> to which they were not conſcious, and <hi>actually conſenting;</hi> but every man will finde <hi>an Adam</hi> in his <hi>own heart;</hi> the <hi>old man</hi> is there, waſting away the <hi>few remaines</hi> of <hi>natural light</hi> and <hi>ſtrength;</hi> and ſhall not God challenge the debt of obedience from a <hi>debtour</hi> that is both <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>prodigal?</hi> we are <hi>proud;</hi> for when we are <hi>miſerable,</hi> we think our ſelves <hi>happy;</hi> and when we are <hi>poor,</hi> we think our ſelves <hi>rich;</hi> and when we are <hi>blind,</hi> we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit our ſelves <hi>very ſeeing;</hi> and when we are <hi>naked,</hi> we think our ſelves <hi>well clad,</hi> Rev. 3.17. and therefore God may <hi>admoniſh</hi> us of our duty, and <hi>demand his right,</hi> if for no other reaſon, but to ſhew us <hi>our impotency,</hi> and that we may not pretend that we were not call'd upon for what we owe; and as man is <hi>proud,</hi> ſo he is <hi>Prodigal;</hi> we ſpend what is left, and throw away thoſe relicks <hi>of conſcience,</hi> and <hi>moral inclinations,</hi> which eſcaped out of the ruines of the fall.</p>

               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:119240:110"/>2. As to the ſecond, How God can <hi>with justice</hi> puniſh him for the neglect of what he could not do?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, our <hi>natural impotency</hi> is <hi>voluntary.</hi> We muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider man only as <hi>impotent to good,</hi> but as <hi>delighting in evil,</hi> and loving it with all his heart; as man <hi>cannot,</hi> ſo he <hi>will not</hi> come to God, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. our <hi>impotency</hi> lies in our <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> and ſo man is left without excuſe; we <hi>refuſe</hi> the grace that is offered to us, and by continuing in ſin, increaſe our bondage, our <hi>inveterate cuſtomes</hi> turning to <hi>another nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the laſt, how God can <hi>exhort</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade</hi> us.</p>
            <p>For anſwer, ſuppoſe we ſhould ſay, This is only for the <hi>elects ſake,</hi> who certainly <hi>are the called according to purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. whereas others are called <hi>obiter, by the by;</hi> and as they live intermingled with them; if the elect did <hi>dwell alone,</hi> and were a <hi>diſtinct community</hi> by themſelves, the objection were plauſible; but they are hidden amongſt others, and therefore the Reprobate have the like favour in the <hi>external means</hi> with them; the world ſtandeth for the elects ſake, yet the Sun doth not ſhine upon them alone, nor the ſhowres fall upon their fields alone; or let me illuſtrate it thus, The <hi>ſun ſhineth,</hi> though <hi>blind men</hi> ſee it not; the raine falls upon the <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Mountains,</hi> as well as the <hi>fruitful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alleys;</hi> ſo are exhortations of duty promiſcuouſly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to good and bad; this might be anſwer enough: but that which I rather ſay, is, that theſe exhortations have their uſe, for they carry their <hi>own bleſſing</hi> with them, to them to whom God means them for good; the word has a <hi>miniſterial ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> to the power of God; as when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> it raiſed him out of his grave; as for others that are not <hi>converted</hi> by them, 'tis for their <hi>conviction,</hi> and to <hi>bridle their fierceneſſe,</hi> and a means to <hi>civilize</hi> them, and keep them from growing worſe, whereby many <hi>temporal bleſſings</hi> do accrue to them; as <hi>Pagan Rome</hi> flouriſhed in all manner of vertue and ſucceſſe, as long as <hi>moral precepts</hi> were in force; but of this more in the next objection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Objection. If man be ſo altogether without ſtrength, why do ye preſſe him to the uſe of means?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, though man cannot <hi>change</hi> himſelf, yet he is to <hi>uſe the means;</hi> and that for ſeveral reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:119240:111"/>1. That we may <hi>practically ſee</hi> our own weakneſſe. Men think the work of grace is eaſie, till they put themſelves upon a trial; the <hi>lameneſſe of the arme</hi> is found in <hi>exerciſe; apply thy heart to understanding,</hi> then <hi>cry for knowledge,</hi> Prov. 2.2, 3. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſets himſelf in <hi>good earneſt</hi> to get any grace, will be forced to <hi>cry</hi> for it before he hath done; we never ſeek ſtrength at Gods hands in ſo feeling a manner, till our experience convince us of our weakneſſe; when a man goes to lift up a piece of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber heavy, above his ſtrength, he is forced to call in help.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>uſe of the means</hi> we owe to God, as well as <hi>the change of the heart;</hi> we lie under a <hi>moral obligation</hi> to uſe them; God that hath required <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>converſion,</hi> hath required <hi>prayer, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, meditating;</hi> and we are bound to obey, though we know not what good will come of it; as<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.8.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham obeyed God, not knowing whither he went;</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> when there was little hope, ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.5. <hi>Howbeit, at thy command,</hi> &amp;c. our great rule is, <hi>We are to do what he commandeth, and let God do what he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To <hi>leſsen our guilt;</hi> for when men do not uſe the means, they have <hi>no excuſe,</hi> 'tis <hi>plaine lazineſſe,</hi> and <hi>want of will,</hi> not <hi>want of power;</hi> when we will not ſo much as try to come out of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, we <hi>love our bondage,</hi> and ſhut the door upon our ſelves; or as that phraſe is, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. <hi>judge our ſelves unworthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life;</hi> paſſe ſentence upon our own ſouls; 'tis a ſign you care not whether God ſhew you mercy yea or no, for you will not ſo much as beſtow a thought upon it; and ſo come under the cenſure of <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>ſloathful ſervants,</hi> Mat. 25.26.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is encouragement in the uſe of means, many wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we do not ſomething, we ſhall <hi>gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:119240:111"/>2. Without the uſe of means they can never <hi>hope</hi> for any thing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they believe without a Preacher?</hi> If ever I meet with God, with Chriſt, it muſt be in this way<note n="*" place="margin">John 5.3, 4, 5</note>; 'tis good to <hi>lie at the Pool,</hi> as the poor man did who was unable to get in when the Angel ſtirred the waters; marriage is inſtituted for the propagation of mankinde; yet the <hi>ſoul is of God only:</hi> no man abſtaineth from marriage becauſe he cannot beget a <hi>reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoul;</hi> ſo grace is <hi>of God;</hi> but hearing, reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are the <hi>inſtituted meanes,</hi> and we muſt not abſtaine from theſe means, becauſe grace is not of our ſelves, but of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It may be God will meet with us;</hi> 'tis the <hi>ordinary practice</hi> of his free grace ſo to do, and its good to make tryal upon a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hope.</hi> Acts 8.22. <hi>Pray if it be poſſible, &amp;c.</hi> There is a <hi>great uncertainty;</hi> yet pray; 'tis Gods uſual way to <hi>meet</hi> with them that <hi>ſeek</hi> him.

               <hi>impdence,</hi> God is not engaged, but who knows what importunity may do? he may, and he may not give grace, but uſually he doth; 'tis <hi>Gods uſual way to bleſs mans induſtry,</hi> and yet all they that labour have not an <hi>abſolute certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of ſucceſſe; who would forbear ploughing becauſe in one year of ten there may happen a dearth or a <hi>lean harveſt?</hi> Act, God may come in (for uſually he doth) with his influence and bleſſing.</p>

When we conſider it, we may wonder at it that ever <hi>ſuch a change</hi> ſhould be wrought in us that are ſo <hi>carnal,</hi> ſo <hi>obſtinate.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. <hi>Wo hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light;</hi> 'tis indeed <hi>marvellous</hi> that ever we ſhould get out of the <hi>priſon of ſinne;</hi> more miraculous than <hi>Peters</hi> getting out of priſon, having ſo <hi>many chaines</hi> and <hi>doores,</hi> and <hi>keepers</hi> upon him, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.</p>

            <p>The Covenant of Redemption (I ſay) is that foederal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction, or mutual ſtipulation that was betwixt God and Chriſt in the great work of mans Redemption. I call it a <hi>foederal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction,</hi> or <hi>mutual stipulation,</hi> becauſe therein lies the nature of a Covenant; 'tis (as Civilians define it) a mutual ſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or agreement betwixt Party and Party upon ſuch and ſuch Termes, with Reciprocal Obligations each of the other.</p>
            <p>That the buſineſſe of Mans Redemption was tranſacted betwixt the Father and the Son is very clear. <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. <hi>The Counſel of peace ſhall be betwixt them both;</hi> the Counſel of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: How man that is now an enemy to God, may be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, and God to him; (for whatever the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay. the Reconciliation is not only on the ſinners part, but on Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) this Counſel or Conſultation ſhall be <hi>betwixt them both;</hi> (that is) Father and Son. I know ſome interpret it of Chriſts offices; the Prieſtly and the Kingly office of Chriſt, both conſpire to make peace betwixt God and man; but I rather take it in the other ſenſe.</p>
            <p>That this tranſaction betwixt theſe two glorious perſons, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>foederal,</hi> or in the way of a Covenant, and that too <hi>from everlasting,</hi> is to me a very great truth, (though I am not ignorant that ſome learned men are not ſo well ſatisfied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.)</p>

            <p n="1">1. He <hi>fits</hi> him for this work, both in a large effuſion of the graces and gifts of the Spirit upon him. <hi>John</hi> 3.34. <hi>God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> And alſo in the preparing of a body for him, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.5.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119240:116"/> the Believers gift, and that is, he gives up himſelf to Chriſt, to be ruled by Chriſt, diſpoſed by Chriſt, ſaved by Chriſt; he gives up himſelf <hi>to the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. The Father giving believers to Chriſt, and promiſing that believers in time ſhould alſo give themſelves to him, was a great encouragement to Chriſt to give himſelf for believers; and if you read <hi>John</hi> 17. you ſhall ſee there, that Chriſt when he had done his work, takes much notice of the accompliſhment of this promiſe to him, in believers (who are his ſeed) owning of him, and cloſing with him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, God will and doth <hi>reward</hi> Chriſt upon his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to redeem man; he tells him he ſhall not loſe by it, <hi>His days ſhall be prolonged;</hi>

            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:119240:116"/>
            <p>You muſt know this, that though a ſinner as to <hi>himſelf,</hi> is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified upon the termes of the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> yet as to his <hi>ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> he is juſtified upon <hi>the Covenant of works;</hi> for the ſurety muſt pay the whole debt, and the Father will bate him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>He undertakes to performe the whole moral Law;</hi> and therefore when he comes into the world, his eye was upon this; <hi>Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteouſneſſe,</hi> Mat. 3.15. <hi>I am not come to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfill,</hi> Mat. 5.17. And all this Chriſt did for our good, <hi>that the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> Rom. 8.4. a very convincing place for the <hi>imputation of Chriſts active obedience.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Father</hi> was free in his demands of ſatisfaction; he might have let man alone in his ſtate of guilt and wrath, he might have ſuffered all man-kind to have periſhed, and to be thrown into hell; he had been infinitely happy in himſelf, though there had been no ſuch thing as Redemption by Chriſt. 'Tis true, without this, God had not had ſatisfaction to his juſtice, (for if <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity had burned in hell to all eternity, all would have been nothing in a way of ſatisfaction) but there had not been the leaſt diminution of his eſſential glory and bleſſedneſſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

            <p>And firſt,<note place="margin">Application.</note> I would from hence ſtir you up to <hi>an high admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great and infinite love of God,</hi> of God the Father, of God the Son; what manner of love hath the God of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in this Covenant! Love, that for the freeneſſe of it, and greatneſſe of it, we ſhould admire in this life, as we ſhall admire it in the life to come. Both perſons have diſcovered unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love in this tranſaction; Oh let both of them be admired with the higheſt admiration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Admire the love of the Father;</hi> we are more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the love of the Son, than we are of the love of the Father. I would not ſpeak any thing to diminiſh the love of the Son; God forbid; Oh 'twas wonderful ſuperlative love! only I would heighten your apprehenſions of the Fathers love in the great work of our Redemption; Redemption was not only brought about by Chriſt, but the Father had a great hand in it; therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall prosper in his hand:</hi> And <hi>I have found a ranſome; God ſo loved the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10. Job 33.24. John 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. I might inſtance in ſeveral particulars to ſet out the Fathers love in our Redemption; but take only that which I have been upon: That the thoughts of God ſhould be upon poor loſt man, ſo as to finde out a way for his recovery; that he ſhould call his Son, and ſay, Come, let us conſult together, (I ſpeak after the manner of men) Is there no way to be found that man may yet live? he is now obnoxious to me, and I might throw him into hell; but may not I be ſatisfied, and he ſaved too? I am not willing he ſhould utterly periſh. I ſay, that God ſhould thus ſet his thoughts on work for wretched man, and treat with his Son, and ſtrike up a Covenant with his Son, and therein lay ſuch a foundation for mans recovery; let Angels and men, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures adore this love; and oh that you would return love for love; return your <hi>drop</hi> for Gods <hi>Ocean.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Secondly, This Covenant of Redemption may be improved <hi>for the encouraging and ſtrengthning of faith:</hi> Faith ſometimes is ready to queſtion the bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace, and the Continuance or Perpetuity of the Covenant of Grace; that's the great Foundation of Faith, and when it ſtaggers about that, 'tis very ſad with the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now I'le lay down two things for the help of Faith.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The bleſſings of the Covenant are ſure.</hi>
               </item>

            </list>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The bleſſings of the Covenant are ſure.</hi> They are called the <hi>ſure mercies of David,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For Continuance;</hi> common mercies are dying, periſhing, uncertain things; but Covenant mercies are ſtable, durable, laſting things. A great eſtate may come to nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. Riches are <hi>uncertain</hi> things,<note place="margin">Imaginaria in ſaeculo, &amp; nihil veri. <hi>Tertul.</hi>
               </note> 1 Tim. 6.17. And ſo in all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts, they are but a <hi>faſhion,</hi> matters of fancy, rather than of reality, and they <hi>paſſe away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.31. But now grace, pardon of ſin, adoption, &amp;c. theſe are bleſſings that abide for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are ſure alſo <hi>for performance;</hi> I mean, whatever bleſſing God hath put into this Covenant, (as 'tis full of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings) all ſhall certainly be made good to believers; otherwiſe God would not be faithful to his Covenant, which certainly he
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:119240:119"/> will be; Men may be falſe in their Covenants to God, but God will certainly be true in his Covenant to men. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall paſſe away, rather than there ſhall be the leaſt entrenchment upon Gods truth, in the not performing of his Covenant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Covenant of Grace is ſure in it ſelf;</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nant firme, unalterable, never to be broken; 'tis called an <hi>everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.7. Hebr. 13.20. a Covenant <hi>that ſhall ſtand faſt,</hi> Pſal. 89.28. a Covenant <hi>ordered in all things, and ſure,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. The Covenant of Grace is ſo firmly ratified, that there can be no nulling of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hath ratified it by his <hi>Oath,</hi> Gen. 22.16. Hebr. 6.13,<note place="margin">Si non credimus Deo promittenti, at credamus Deo juranti. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom.</hi> Amant Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturae pro pacto ponere Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. His promiſe is enough, but ſurely h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s oath muſt put all out of queſtion; there's no room for unbelief, now God hath ſworn to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath ratified it by the <hi>death</hi> of his Son: A mans laſt Will as ſoon as he is dead, is in force, and cannot then be diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Covenant of Grace is a <hi>Teſtamentary</hi> Covenant, which by the death of the Teſtator is ſo ſetled, that there's no altering of it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, <hi>&amp;c. Hebr.</hi> 9.15, 16.</p>
            <p>Again, the Covenant of Grace is ratified by the <hi>ſeals</hi> which God hath annexed to it. What was ſealed by the Kings ring could not be altered: <hi>Esther</hi> 8.8. God hath ſet his ſeal to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, his <hi>broad</hi> ſeal in the Sacraments, his <hi>privy</hi> ſeal in the witneſſe of his Spirit; and therefore 'tis ſure, and cannot be reverſt.</p>
            <p>And further than all this, 'tis ratified in and by that <hi>Covenant</hi> which hath been now opened; The Covenant of Redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Chriſt, ſecures the Covenant of Grace betwixt God and believers. What God promiſes us, he did before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto Chriſt, and the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther would not make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto Chriſt, if he ſhould not make good his promiſes to the Saints. And therefore as in other reſpects, ſo in this alſo, the Covenant may be ſaid to be <hi>confirmed of God in Christ,</hi> Gal. 3.17. with reſpect to that paction and ſtipulation that was betwixt them.</p>
            <p>I lay all this before you for the ſtrengthning of your Faith, as to the ſtability of the Covenant of Grace; ſo long as that Covenant
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119240:120"/> ſtands, you are ſafe; and you ſee there's no queſtion but that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will ſtand, which God hath ſet upon ſuch firme pillars. This promiſe in the Text, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> will aſſuredly bring every believer into heaven. O that faith might triumph in the conſideration of this, the Covenant of grace is ſure. <hi>Davids</hi> Faith did ſo, when death was in his eye, and affliction in his eye; <hi>Yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure; for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. When Faith begins to faint, look up to this Covenant, and reaſon thus; God will not alter his promiſe to me, but to be ſure he will not alter his promiſe to his Son. I may fail in ſuch and ſuch conditions, but Chriſt hath been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all; every childe of God may take much comfort from this.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> In the third and laſt place, I would have you to enquire what <hi>this Covenant of Redemption is to you.</hi> Here's a bleſſed Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt the Father and the Son; how far are you and I inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in it, or like to receive benefit by it?

            <p n="2">2. I know not how to believe that there ſhould be a ſolemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt the Father and the Son, upon which never any man ſhould be the better; Did ever any ſinner get any thing by this univerſal Covenant?</p>

This was the great reaſon that prevailed with theſe worthy men to aſſert ſuch a Covenant. I know no Covenant but that ſpecial Covenant into which the ſeed of Chriſt were only taken. I am loth to fall into the duſty roade of Controverſies; all along in this Diſcourſe, where I could not avoide them, I have but juſt croſſ'd them over, and ſo preſently falne in again into ſome more quiet and private way.</p>

That 'tis the Elect only who are concerned in this Covenant:</hi> Such and ſuch perſons there were, (<hi>individually</hi> conſidered) whom God the Father in his Electing love doth freely give to Chriſt; for theſe, and only for theſe, doth the Lord Jeſus engage to lay down his life: <hi>Redemption</hi> on the Sons part ſhall be no lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than <hi>Election</hi> on the Fathers part, that there may be a perfect Harmony and Agreement betwixt them in their love.</p>
            <p>So then Beloved, if you would draw down comfort to your ſelves from this Covenant, you muſt finde out this, that you are the Elect of God, choſen of him to be Veſſels of his mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was; Chriſt undertook to give his life only for thoſe whom the Father had firſt given to him; theſe he only <hi>pray'd</hi> for, and therefore ſurely theſe he only <hi>dy'd</hi> for.</p>
            <p>You'le ſay I put you upon a very difficult ſearch; 'tis true, 'tis very hard for a man to know his Election, but yet it may be known; otherwiſe the Apoſtle would never have urged this as a duty upon Chriſtians, <hi>To make their Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Paul</hi> knew that the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were <hi>elected of God,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.4. And he did not know it by Revelation only; No, he gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account of it; he knew it by way of inference from what he ſaw of God in them: <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. <hi>For our Goſpel came not to you in Word only, but alſo in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> If Election may be known by others, why not by our ſelves?</p>

            <p>A Covenant is, <hi>amicus ſtatus interfaederatos;</hi> ſo <hi>Martin.</hi> a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate between Allies; 'pray 'conſider the ſeveral Covenants the Scripture mentions, and they are three; namely the <hi>Natural, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> Covenant; the <hi>Natural</hi> commonly called the Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> that flouriſhed till the firſt ſin; the <hi>Legal</hi> Covenant that flouriſhed till the Aſcention of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the pouring out of the holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, though it began to languiſh from <hi>Johns</hi> preaching, and began to grow old throuh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the courſe of Chriſts Mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>try; the <hi>Gosp l</hi> Covenant that flouriſheth from Chriſt till the end of the world.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak but <hi>little</hi> of the firſt, ſomething <hi>more</hi> of the ſecond, but <hi>dwell</hi> upon the laſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Natural</hi> Covenant, is that whereby God by the right of Creation, doth require a perfect obedience of all man-kind, and promiſeth a moſt bleſſed life in Paradiſe to thoſe that obey
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119240:123"/> him, and threateneth eternal death to thoſe that diſobey him, that it may appeare to all how he loves righteouſneſſe and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; how he hates impiety and wickedneſſe. In this Covenant I ſhall conſider but theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods condiſcention,</hi> that he would enter into Covenant with man; God was at liberty whether he would create man or not; and when God had made this glorious Fabrick, there could be no engagement upon him, beſides his own goodneſſe to keep it from ruine. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> but man having an underſtanding, and will, to comprehend, and obſerve, the Laws given him, had a <hi>natural</hi> obligation to duty, which can no way be diſſolved; there is no power in heaven or earth can diſoblige man from <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying</hi> God. Now that God will deale with man not <hi>ſummo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> not imperiouſly, and threateningly; but <hi>magna comitate,</hi> that God will deale with man, as with his friend; and though he may give what Laws he will, yet he will give none but what are eaſie, and yet make them more eaſie, by bountifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding an eaſie obedience; this ſpeaks wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcention.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing conſiderable in the <hi>Natural</hi> Covenant is <hi>mans duty,</hi> which conſiſted in the <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God; whence would have proceeded piety to God, juſtice and love to man, this was mans <hi>natural duty;</hi> for we muſt diſtinguiſh the <hi>duty</hi> from the <hi>Symbole</hi> of duty. <hi>Natural duty</hi> conſiſteth in thoſe things that are good in their <hi>own nature,</hi> and not in thoſe things that are only good <hi>becauſe God commands them;</hi> the Law about the forbidden fruit, was only for the <hi>tryal</hi> of mans obedience; for had not the divine command intervened, it would have been as lawful for man to have eaten of that Tree, as any other Tree in Paradiſe; but,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt thing I ſhall mention concerning this Natural Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is the <hi>Promiſe of Reward;</hi> now that conſiſted in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual life, flowing with all manner of good things, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſoule and body of man in that perfect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Covenant was the <hi>Legal;</hi> now the Legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is that <hi>whereby God did r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quire of the people of Iſrael, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Moral, Ceremonial and Judicial Law; and to that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119240:123"/> he promiſed all ſorts of bleſſings in the Land of Canaan; and to the diſ bedient, he denounced moſt ſevere curſes and death; and all to this end, that he might bring them to the future Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I ſhall propoſe the ſame conſiderations, as in the former Covenant; only ſomething more. Therefore conſider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods <hi>condiſcention</hi> is ſingularly obſervable, that ever he would enter into another Covenant with man when the firſt was broken; this <hi>Moſes</hi> uſeth as a mighty Argument to perſwade <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to obſerve the Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. from the 32. to the 40. verſe. <hi>Ask now of the dayes that are paſt, which were before thee, ſince the day that God created man upon earth; and ask from the one ſide of heaven unto thie other, whether there hath been any ſuch thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it. Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midſt of the fire, as thou haſt heard, and live? Or hath God aſſayed to go and take him a Nation from the midſt of another Nation, by temptations, by ſignes, and by wonders, and by warre, and by a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched-out arme, and by great terrours, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou ſhalt therefore keep his Statutes, and his Commandments, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and thy children after thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>mans duty</hi> in the <hi>Legal</hi> Covenant, and that is <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the moral Law;</hi> to which was added the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, for a Rule and Direction in the worſhip of God; and the <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Law, which was their divine policy for the government of the State.</p>
            <p>All theſe are comprehended in the ten Commandments; but the more-particular their directions were, the more plain was their duty; and the truth is, it was but need that they ſhould have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction, when their Legal Covenant neither admitted of <hi>faith</hi> in the Redeemer, nor <hi>repentance</hi> of ſin; for pardon of ſin, and curſe for ſin are inconſiſtent. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the Curſe; for it is written, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them;</hi> As many as depend upon the works of the Law for Juſtification, are under the curſe; and the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119240:124"/> Law diſcovered no other way of Juſtification but by Works.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing conſiderable in the Legal Covenant, is the <hi>promiſe</hi> that God made to thoſe that obeyed it, and that was <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual happineſs in the Land of Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[By the way to prevent miſtakes, I do not ſay, neither will the Scripture at all warrant any ſuch aſſertion, as that the Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament had only temporal promiſes; they had ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation promiſed them, and pardon of ſin promiſed them; but <hi>thanks to the Gospel for thoſe promiſes;</hi> the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the Law which was foure hundred and thirty years after, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſannull, that it ſhould make the promiſe of none effect;</hi> the Morning Star of the Goſpel Covenant that ſhone upon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> foure hundred and thirty years before the Legal Covenant was given, did ſhine thorough that dark diſpenſation.]</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak of the <hi>Legal</hi> promiſes as <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p>Here I ſhall propoſe the ſame conſiderations as in the former Covenant, only ſtill ſomething more, and more comfortably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; in the conſideration of the perſons contracting, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> according to the propoſed method.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing conſiderable, is the <hi>duty</hi> which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in this Goſpel Covenant, and that is <hi>Faith;</hi> faith whereby
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:119240:125"/> we embrace the remedy offered us: We want a pardon, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>faith</hi> can receive it; we want perfect Righteouſneſſe, and nothing but <hi>faith</hi> can furniſh us with it; we want that which may make this Covenant effectual to us, and make it a bleſſing to us, and nothing can do any of theſe things but <hi>faith;</hi> faith is the <hi>Antecedent Condition,</hi> for which the Reward is given.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing conſiderable in the Goſpel Covenant, is the <hi>promiſe:</hi> Now the promiſe of the Goſpel Covenant is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the word <hi>Salvation;</hi> therefore the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of God: <hi>Acts</hi> 28.28. And this is the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a <hi>Saviour; Iſa.</hi> 49.6. <hi>That thou mayſt be my ſalvation to the end of the earth;</hi> when the <hi>Angels</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpel, they thought they could not expreſſe their news in better language, than to tell people of <hi>ſalvation;</hi> that muſt needs be <hi>great joy to all people.</hi> In ſhort, when Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters come clad with <hi>garments of ſalvation,</hi> as <hi>Heraulds</hi> do with the garments of their Office, then <hi>Saints</hi> may well <hi>ſhout aloud for joy,</hi> Pſal. 132.16. Now this promiſe of ſalvation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all Goſpel promiſes in it, but they are reduced to theſe foure.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Juſtification;</hi> this is a priviledge which other Covenants were unacquainted with; and without this what would become of poor ſinful man? And this may well be the firſt great Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; I might name, not ſome Verſes, but whole Chapters to prove it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. and 4. but in a word, if you would know the <hi>preciouſneſs</hi> of this promiſe, <hi>Ask thoſe that have but felt what ſin is,</hi> and they will tell you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond promiſe contained in Goſpel ſalvation, is <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</hi> Rom. 8.2, 3, 4. <hi>The Law of the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The efficacy and power of the ſanctifying Spirit which gives life to believers, frees us from the tyranny of ſin and death; and whereas the Law by reaſon of the corruption of our nature, could not make us pure and perfect, but rather kindled
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119240:125"/> than extinguiſhed corruption; God hath cloathed his Son with our fleſh, to take away the guilt and power of ſin, that his perfect righteouſneſſe might be <hi>imputed to us,</hi> and <hi>fulfill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. The third promiſe, is the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the body: You know the <hi>penal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The laſt promiſe is <hi>Eternal life,</hi> a ſpiritual, bleſſed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life in heaven. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlasting life:</hi> The Covenant of Grace is excellent fitted to bring us to the chiefeſt good: Now the chiefeſt good conſiſts in <hi>communion with God;</hi> that was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſin, and can never be perfectly recovered, till ſin be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; therefore when the guilt of ſin is taken away by <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and the filthineſſe of ſin is taken away by <hi>Sanctification;</hi> and the penalty of ſin taken away by <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> then, what can hinder our <hi>communion with God?</hi> when we have once obtained perfect <hi>holineſſe,</hi> nothing can hinder us of perfect <hi>happineſſe.</hi> Thus you have the promiſe of the Goſpel-Covenant, which was the third conſiderable in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth thing to be conſidered in the Goſpel-Covenant, is the <hi>Mediator</hi> of this better Covenant, and that is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> God-man bleſſed for ever, through his dignity he hath purchaſed ſalvation. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.12, 14. <hi>By his own blood he entred in once into the holy place, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us; how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit offered himſelf without spot to God, &amp;c.</hi> And he is not only the <hi>Author</hi> of Eternal ſalvation by his <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>efficacy,</hi> but the moſt abſolute <hi>example</hi> and <hi>pattern</hi> to us, how we ſhould
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:119240:126"/> walk that we may obtain his <hi>purchaſed</hi> ſalvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. God did <hi>predeſtinate us to be conformable to the Image of his Sonne, that he might be the first born among many brethren.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. <hi>And as we have born the Image of the Earthly, we ſhall alſo bear the Image of the heavenly.</hi> And this is the only Covenant whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Mediator;</hi> the firſt Covenant needed no Mediator; the Old Covenant as <hi>Legal,</hi> take it without its ſprinkling of Goſpel, and ſo chiefly <hi>Moſes,</hi> but in all reſpects <hi>meer men</hi> were <hi>Mediators;</hi> but of the New Covenant <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>Mediator;</hi> but this I ſhall leave to be enlarged by another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth thing to be conſidered in the Goſpel-Covenant, is the <hi>efficacy</hi> of it. I did not ſo much as mention the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the former Covenants; for there was never ſo much as <hi>any one</hi> made happy by them; 'tis ſadly true, that the threatnings of puniſhment for the neglect of duty took hold of them; the threatnings ſeemed plainly to belong to the <hi>nature of thoſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;</hi> but in the Goſpel Covenant 'tis otherwiſe; for it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>abides]</hi> which ſhews that the wrath was brought upon them by the violation of the <hi>former</hi> Covenant, he ſpeaks as of that which was upon them already.</p>
            <p>[But yet miſtake not, as if <hi>refuſing</hi> the Goſpel were no <hi>ſin,</hi> or not <hi>puniſhed;</hi> they ſin more grievouſly, that ſin againſt <hi>Gospel love,</hi> than they that ſin only againſt <hi>Legal goodneſs;</hi> but wrath doth not <hi>properly</hi> belong to the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Goſpel.]</p>
            <p>Thus you have the firſt thing I undertook, namely, the <hi>nature</hi> of the Covenant <hi>poſitively</hi> conſidered; the ſecond is the <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> excellency of the <hi>New</hi> Covenant above others: I will be brief in ſhewing its excellency above the Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> more large in ſhewing you how 'tis better than the <hi>Old</hi> Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>[Only ſuppoſe, to prevent miſtakes, that <hi>each Covenant is in its own kind most perfect,</hi> and moſt <hi>accommodated</hi> to the ſtate of the <hi>people,</hi> and to the <hi>purpoſes</hi> for which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.</p>
            <p>This premiſed:]</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>New</hi> Covenant of Grace is better than the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Nature;</hi> I forbear to ſpeak of the <hi>agreement</hi> and <hi>diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of them, I ſhall ſpeak only of the <hi>excellency</hi> of this better Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:119240:126"/>1. The <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works</hi> was a <hi>Declaration</hi> of Gods <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> than which nothing can be more <hi>terrible</hi> to a guilty ſinner; but the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> is a <hi>Declaration</hi> of Gods <hi>mercy in Chriſt,</hi> and let the overwhelmed conſcience ſpeak, <hi>is not this better?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Covenant of Works, was the <hi>Creation</hi> of man, and the integrity of his nature; the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, is mans <hi>Redemption</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the Covenant of Works, was eternal life in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the New Covenant, is eternal life in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Covenant of Works had no <hi>Mediator,</hi> no poſſibility of recovering the leaſt ſlip; the New Covenant is ratified in the blood of the Son of God; 'tis compoſed on purpoſe for our relief<note n="*" place="margin">Camero.</note>: Thus the <hi>New</hi> Covenant is better than the Covenant of <hi>Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi> is better than the <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi> Beloved, you may obſerve, I do not ſay <hi>better</hi> than the Covenant <hi>strictly Legal;</hi> but <hi>better</hi> than the <hi>whole Diſpenſation</hi> which the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all other <hi>Believers</hi> lived under, before <hi>Chriſts</hi> Incarnation; <hi>better</hi> than the <hi>Old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſpiritual grace</hi> delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, openly</hi> promiſing <hi>Eternal</hi> life unto the <hi>Fathers;</hi> and the <hi>Dull</hi> people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> under the <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>perfect obedience</hi> to the Moral <hi>Law,</hi> together with the <hi>intolerable</hi> burdens of Legal rights, and <hi>yoke</hi> of moſt ſtraight <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> policy; but <hi>covertly</hi> under the <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> in the future <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> prefigured in the <hi>ſhadowes</hi> and <hi>types</hi> of Ceremonies, that by this forme of Divine <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>policy,</hi> a ſtiffe-necked people might partly be <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> and partly be <hi>brought to Chriſt,</hi> that lay <hi>hid</hi> under thoſe Ceremonies. So that in ſhort you ſee the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> (for by a <hi>Metonymie</hi> they are chiefly one and the ſame thing; and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> plainly ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Untill this day remaineth the ſame vaile untaken away in the reading of the Old Teſtament, which vaile is done away in Christ;</hi> and this) contains theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:119240:127"/>1. The old kind of doctrine which was <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>principally Legal; covertly,</hi> and <hi>leſſe principally,</hi> Evangelical.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We have three notable advantages in our temporal promiſes, beyond what they had in theirs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Old</hi> Covenant had ſpecial promiſes of temporal good things in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for the preſerving of their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> policy, untill the time of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be born of <hi>that</hi> people; promiſes of long life, &amp;c. The New Covenant hath promiſes of all good things neceſſary, without any ſuch clog.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The temporal good things promiſed in the Old Teſtament, were <hi>ſymbolical;</hi> they prefigured ſpiritual benefits by Chriſt; we have them without any ſuch adjoyned ſignifications, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. <hi>They had a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ;</hi> They had a more ſparing taſte of heavenly good things in earthly benefits; we have a more ſtreight and direct way unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

The meaſure of the Spirit which they did receive, tended moſtly to <hi>bondage,</hi> Gal. 4.24, 25. but the Spirit is to us a Spirit of <hi>Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.15. And therefore the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is ſpecially cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Word of Gods grace,</hi> Acts 20.32. as if <hi>all</hi> the grace that God had formerly expreſſed, had been <hi>nothing</hi> in compariſon of this. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Ye are not under the Law, but under grace; Law</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> are oppoſed as <hi>condemnation</hi> and <hi>mercy;</hi> thus the Goſpel is the better Covenant, in reſpect of the <hi>promiſes</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

               <hi>eventus adventitius,</hi> an accidental event. God abundantly declares in the Goſpel, that he delights not in the <hi>death</hi> of ſinners, but in the <hi>ſaving</hi> tranſlation of them by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> from the <hi>power</hi> of darkneſſe, into the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of his dear Son.

            <p n="6">6. The Goſpel-Covenant is the better Covenant, in reſpect of its <hi>objects</hi> or perſons taken into Covenant, and that under a double conſideration, their <hi>multiplicity,</hi> and their <hi>quality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the <hi>number:</hi> The Old Covenant belonged only to <hi>one people;</hi> the New, to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles; Abraham</hi> and his poſterity were taken into Covenant, and all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide were excluded; thoſe few others that were admitted, it was by extraordinary grace, and they were as it were <hi>planted</hi> into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family; but now the partition Wall is broken down, which as it were, ſhut up the mercy of God in the confines of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Now <hi>peace</hi> is proclaimed to thoſe that are <hi>far off,</hi> as well as to thoſe that are <hi>near,</hi> that they might become one people; this is a great myſtery, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.26.

            <p n="2">2. The Goſpel-Covenant is better in reſpect of the <hi>quality</hi> of the perſons taken into it; the Law is propoſed to wicked, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and hardened ſinners. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs, and diſobedient, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and for ſinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers, and murd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7.

'Tis true, the Law was given with Thunder and Lightning, and terrible Miracles; the Goſpel was atteſted with a comfortable voice from heaven, and healing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; but as ſinners broken by the Law, needed ſome Goſpel-balm to heal their wounds; ſo ſecure Goſpel ſinners need Legal threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to fright them out of their ſluggiſhneſſe, and ſleepy ſecurity. If whiſpers of peace will not awaken them, we muſt cry aloud, to ſtir them up if it be poſſible, to break off ſinning, and to minde ſalvation.

Sirs, what doth this call for? what ſhall we render to the Lord for this — (I know not what to call it, 'tis ſuch) unſpeakable love? Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I muſt both give, and take time to anſwer this queſtion; And O that you, and I may give a ſutable anſwer to it.

               <p n="3">3. By way of Inference; Everyone of you that is not in the <hi>Goſpel-Covenant,</hi> is in a dreadful ſtate; 'tis your own wilfulneſſe, you will not believe the Goſpel. Though 'tis through <hi>Divine Grace</hi> that perſons do cloſe with the Goſpel, yet it is your own
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119240:132"/> 
                  <hi>ſin</hi> you do not cloſe with it; for you are willing to be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to it, you are willing to enjoy your luſts, which you muſt part with, if you embrace it. You may obſerve the dreadful eſtate of perſons out of Covenant in theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>ſin</hi> againſt the Goſpel-Covenant is moſt dreadful. This ſin hath the guilt of all other ſins in it. <hi>John</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had ſin, but now they have no cloke for their ſin. Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdome of heaven, before thoſe that refuſe the Goſpel. God the Father invites men to the Marriage Supper; nay, you are <hi>wooed</hi> and <hi>entreated</hi> to be Chriſts <hi>Bride:</hi> You make light of it, you have the profits and the pleaſures of the world, to take up your thoughts, you will not be perſwaded to believe that Chriſt is better than your luſts; you will not be beat out of it, but that a <hi>bag</hi> of gold, is better than a <hi>Crown</hi> of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but that a filthy <hi>luſt,</hi> is better than <hi>communion</hi> with God; but that the Divels <hi>ſlave</hi> and <hi>fool,</hi> is better than to be Gods <hi>Childe</hi> and <hi>Darling;</hi> Is this your choice? Then conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>penalty</hi> for the contempt of this Goſpel-Covenant is moſt dreadful. <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather than light;</hi> this brings perſons under the very <hi>utmoſt</hi> of the wrath of God. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. when the Jews ſinned againſt the Legal Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Daniel</hi> complains, <hi>Under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens hath not been done as hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To poure contempt and ſcorne upon the pretious blood of Chriſt, wherewith the Covenant betwixt God and his people was made, and ratified; to offer a ſpiteful affront unto the Spirit of God, by contemning, and oppoſing his gracious motions; O what remains for ſuch perſons but a dreadful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods terrible Judgment! But there's a third thing that I would have you conſider, which is ſenſibly more dreadful than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:119240:133"/>3. The <hi>ſentence</hi> againſt Goſpel-Covenant breaking is moſt <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverſible</hi> and <hi>peremptory,</hi> mercy, and grace, and patience, and compaſſion, when theſe are abuſed, all theſe become the ſinners enemy; for that which is ordained a life, to prove death unto them, oh this is dreadful! for the blood of Chriſt to cry to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt ſinners, this is dreadful! this made Chriſt to weep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke 19.40.41. Theſe perſons paſſe judgment upon themſelves, though not with their lips, yet with their lives; they pronounce themſelves unworthy to be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. O Sirs, I beſeech you conſider, though perſons brake the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Works,</hi> there was ſalvation to be had by another Covenant; but if <hi>this</hi> be violated, there is <hi>no</hi> other Covenant to relieve this: The Goſpel-Covenant is our Refuge, when the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant purſues us. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.18. Contemptuous carriage againſt Grace is beyond all help; I beſeech you therefore take heed of ſinning againſt Goſpel-light, and Goſpel-love. O you will have that <hi>ſting</hi> of conſcience that no other ſinners in the world have, that have not refuſed a Redeemer. Beloved, I would I could ſay, with due meltings of heart, it grieves me for you, to think how many hundreds in this Congregation are yet <hi>without Chriſt, being Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. O Sirs, do you know what you do, when you cocker your luſts in deſpight of Chriſt? Can you hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and go on in ſin? You do well to hear, but you make a deſperate adventure, to do what you know, diſcovenants you from God, and hazards your eternal ſeparation from God. Beloved, I muſt be plain with you; I beſeech you conſider how <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Divels</hi> will riſe up in judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jew</hi> may ſay, I had a Legal yoke upon me, which neither I, nor my Fathers were able to bear; Chriſt invited me only into his <hi>Garden of Nuts,</hi> where I might ſooner break my teeth with the hard <hi>Shell of Ceremonies,</hi> than get to the (little more than bitter) <hi>Kenel of Gospel promiſes;</hi> you have thoſe promiſes in abundance with more eaſe. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.11. q. d.

Oh had we but one of your days of the Son of man, we would not have ſinned againſt ſo great ſalvation! Sirs, what do you think your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will be forced to reply?</p>
               <q>O true, true, muſt the Gospel-ſinner ſay; I have known, own'd, and profeſſed Chriſt, and have been angry with Ministers and Friends, when they did but queſtion my being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but I have not in any meaſure walked worthy of the Goſpel. <hi>But I paſſe by the</hi> Jew; <hi>let's hear what the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>hath to ſay againſt you.</hi>
               </q>
               <p n="2">2. I periſh Eternally, may the poor <hi>Pagan</hi> ſay, without all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Reconciliation, and have only ſinned againſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Works,</hi> having never heard of a <hi>Gospel</hi>-Covenant, nor of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> by a <hi>Mediatour.</hi> Alas! ſhould I have improved my <hi>Naturals</hi> to the higheſt, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have <hi>entred</hi> into my head. Oh had I heard but <hi>one</hi> Sermon! had Chriſt but <hi>once</hi> broke in upon my ſoul, to convince me of my undone condition, and to have ſhewen a righteouſneſſe unto me; but woe is me, I never had ſo much as <hi>one</hi> offer of Grace!</p>
               <q>But ſo have I, muſt you ſay that refuſe the Gospel; I have, or might have heard thouſands of Sermons; I could ſcarce eſcape hearing one or other, ſhewing me the danger of my ſin, and my neceſſity of Chriſt; but notwithſtanding all I heard, I wilfully reſolved, I would have nothing to do with him, I could not indure to hear ſtrictneſſe preſt upon me; it was all the hell I had upon earth, that I could not ſin in quiet.</q>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:119240:134"/>3. Nay, may the <hi>Divel</hi> himſelf ſay; 'tis true, I was ever ſince my fall <hi>maliciouſly</hi> ſet againſt God: But alas, ſo ſoon as ever I firſt ſinned, God kick't me out of heaven, and told me he would never have mercy on me. And 'though I liv'd in the time of all manner of gracious Diſpenſations; I ſaw <hi>Sacrifices</hi> offered, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the fleſh, and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> preached; yet how could this chooſe but enrage me the more, to have God as it were ſay, Look here <hi>Satan,</hi> I have provided a remedy for ſin, but none for <hi>thine!</hi> this ſet me upon <hi>revenge</hi> againſt God, ſo far as I could reach him. But alas, alas! had God ever entred into any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with me at all; had God put me upon any terms, <hi>though never ſo hard,</hi> for the obtaining of mercy; had Chriſt been but <hi>once</hi> offered to me, what do you think would I have done? would I have hearkened to any thing you could ſay, to Refuſe Chriſt and Salvation? Could you, or all the Angels in heaven have kept me from minding Chriſt? But,
<q>Woe to me, may the Goſpel-ſinner ſay: I have as good a <hi>Remnant</hi> of the Covenant of <hi>Works</hi> in my nature, as the <hi>Pagans</hi> have. I have all the diſcoveries of God in the <hi>Legal</hi> Covenant, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ever had. I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Better</hi> Diſpenſation than the <hi>Divels</hi> were under before their Fall. The Goſpel of <hi>Grace</hi> is urged upon me. And therefore, O poor <hi>Jew!</hi> whatever may be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy breach of Covenant, there's a <hi>thouſand</hi> fold more to be ſaid againſt mine. O poor <hi>Pagan!</hi> whatever is to be ſaid againſt thy breach of Covenant, there's <hi>ten thouſand</hi> fold more againſt mine. O wretched <hi>Divels!</hi> whatever may be ſaid againſt your ſinnes, there's <hi>infinitely</hi> more to be ſaid againſt mine.

               </p>
               <p>Sirs, Is all this nothing to you? Can you hear theſe things quietly? I know you dare not think them over again, and ſin at the ſame rate as before; if you think your ſouls any thing worth, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and glory any thing worth, now offer up your ſelves to Chriſt in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119240:134"/> the Goſpel-Covenant. Thus much for the firſt Inference, That their eſtate is dreadful that are not in the Goſpel-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Inference is this; That their eſtate is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable that are in the Goſpel-Covenant; I will only inſtance in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>weakeſt</hi> and <hi>pooreſt</hi> faith, and ſervice, is accepted through <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpel-Covenant. The Covenant of Grace is made to poor, weak, ſinful, fraile man through a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator;</hi> God doth not expect that we ſhould be perfect here: Poor Chriſtians have more ado to <hi>pardon themſelves,</hi> than to have God to <hi>pardon them.</hi> They <hi>quarrel</hi> more with themſelves for want of holineſſe, than God <hi>quarrels</hi> with them for it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, here are ſome comfortable <hi>Riddles</hi> of Grace for you to reſolve. The Covenant is meerly of Grace, <hi>Grace</hi> runs through all the <hi>veins,</hi> and <hi>arteries</hi> of it; all the life, blood, and ſpirit of the Covenant, are <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> through <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> And yet Beloved, though it be wholly of Grace, it is of <hi>Debt</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Covenant; God is pleaſed to enter into <hi>Bond</hi> to make good his <hi>Deed of Gift.</hi> What God doth for the heires of <hi>promiſe,</hi> it is no more than what is <hi>debt</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and what through him he is graciouſly engaged for us. O the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of being in Covenant with God! you will ſay ſo indeed if you adde,</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Goſpel-Covenant is ſo made, that it can never be <hi>diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul'd.</hi> Alas, we do not know <hi>where,</hi> nor <hi>how</hi> to make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>ſure</hi> in the world; he that is my <hi>friend</hi> to day, may be my <hi>enemy</hi> to morrow; his Bond may be <hi>good</hi> to day, and may be to morrow <hi>inſoluble.</hi> There are ways more than we know of to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the <hi>stricteſt</hi> Covenant, to diſanull the <hi>strongeſt</hi> Oath; but now God hath ſworn by himſelf, (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.13.) that he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bleſſe thoſe whom he takes into Covenant with him. <hi>God hath ſworn by his holineſſe,</hi> Pſal. 89.34, 35. As if he ſhould ſay, Let me not be accounted a <hi>holy</hi> God, if I break Covenant with any of my people. Nay, he ſwears by his <hi>life,</hi> Iſa. 49.18, 18. The Prophet ſpeaks there of <hi>Sion,</hi> as of a Mother-City, and of multitudes that ſhould be brought home to her by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and that they ſhall be as <hi>Jewels</hi> and <hi>Ornaments,</hi> matter of much honour to her by their e dowments with ſpiritual
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:119240:135"/> graces: Thus Goſpel-Covenanters ſhall be qualified. But you will preſently ſay, there is no danger of <hi>Gods</hi> breaking Covenant, all the danger is on <hi>our</hi> part; but Chriſtians, there is not ſo much danger on <hi>our</hi> part, as many fear; it is not <hi>every</hi> ſin that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently breaks the Covenant; a wife may be <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>paſſionate,</hi> yet the marriage is not thereby broken. And when we do ſlip into Covenant-breaches, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ready to <hi>pardon</hi> us, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt ready to <hi>piece</hi> up our breaches. <hi>Provided</hi> that we do but make conſcience in the <hi>whole</hi> courſe of our lives to keep Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I hope by all that hath been ſpoken, you will be perſwaded to <hi>enter</hi> into Covenant, and to <hi>keep</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God; if ſo, I have my <hi>End,</hi> and ſo hath my Sermon.</p>

            <p n="5">
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:119240:139"/>5. He that hath life in himſelf, and is the fountain of life to others, muſt needs be God; and thus is Chriſt <hi>the Prince of life to others,</hi> Acts 3.15. and <hi>hath life in himſelfe,</hi> Joh. 5.26.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He to whom thoſe works of infiniteneſſe are aſcribed, to which no leſſe a power is ſufficient than that of Omnipotency, he muſt needs be more than a creature. He that laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the earth, that by a word commanded all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that preſerves them from mouldring, and ſinking into their firſt nothing again; that could pardon ſin, deſtroy him that had power of death,<note place="margin">Mark 2.5, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c. Heb. 2.14.</note> ſubdue principalities and powers, Redeem his Church, carry his people triumphing into heaven; he muſt needs be God. And all theſe works of infiniteneſſe are aſcribed to Chriſt; the work of Creation, <hi>Without him was nothing made of all that was made,</hi> Joh. 1.3. Of conſervation, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding all things by the Word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1.3. of redemption, which <hi>he purchaſed with his blood,</hi> Acts 20.28.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He whom Angels adore, before whom the higheſt and beſt of creatures fall down, giving that worſhip which is peculiarly due to God, muſt needs be more than a creature; and thus it is to Chriſt. <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1.6. ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.11.</p>
            <p>I might adde the equality of Chriſt in all thoſe ſolemn benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and praiſes upon Record in the New Teſtament; all which argue ſtrongly, that he muſt needs be truly God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As he is truly God, ſo is he compleat and perfect man; having not only an humane body, but a rational ſoul; and <hi>in all things was like to us, ſin only excepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he had a real, not an imaginary body, appeares from the whole ſtory of the Goſpel. He that was conceived, born, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,<note place="margin">Gerhardi Loci Commun. Forbeſ Disputat. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico. Theolog. L. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> was hungred, athirſt, ſwet drops of blood, was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; he that went from place to place, and had all thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe affections, which are proper unto bodies: had a true and real body; and ſuch was the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That he had an humane ſoul, is clear alſo from the ſtory of the Goſpel. He that grew in wiſdome and knowledge, as 'tis ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.80. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.40. he whoſe knowledge was bounded and limited, as was alſo ſaid of Chriſt. <hi>Of that

               </note> 
               <hi>neither the Sonne of man, but the Father,</hi> Mark 13.32. As God he knew all things; as man, his knowledge was but the knowledge of a creature, and therefore finite; all which argue he had a humane ſoul, as well as body, and was compleat man. The whole Nature of man was corrupted, deſtroyed, and therefore 'twas needful Chriſt ſhould take upon him whole man, that the whole might be repaired and ſaved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is God and man in one perſon. He had two Natures, but was but one perſon: there was a twofold ſubſtance, divine and humane; but not a twofold ſubſiſtence; for the perſonal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the Son of God had before all worlds,<note place="margin">Hooker Eccleſ. pol. pag. <hi>293.</hi>
               </note> ſuffered not the ſubſtance to be perſonal which he took, although together with the Nature which he had, the Nature which he took con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever; thus both Natures make but one Chriſt. He was the Son of God, and the Son of man, yet not two Sons, but one perſon. He was born of God, and born of a Virgin,<note place="margin">Lyford. p. <hi>100.</hi>
               </note> but 'tis in reſpect of his different Natures. Thus was Chriſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Son, and <hi>Davids</hi> Lord; <hi>Maries</hi> Son, and <hi>Maries</hi> Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Maker too.</p>
            <p>By the right underſtanding of this, we may be very much hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in reconciling thoſe ſeeming contradictions, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurre in Scripture concerning Chriſt. He is ſaid to be born of a woman, and yet to be without beginning of dayes;<note place="margin">Zanch. in Epheſ. p <hi>35.</hi>
               </note> himſelf ſayes his Father is greater than he, and yet he is ſaid to be equal with the Father. All which may be cleared by this. He was but one perſon; and therefore as in man, who conſiſts of ſoul and body, the actions of each part are aſcribed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: the man is ſaid to underſtand; 'tis not his body, but ſoul that underſtands; yet this is aſcribed to the perſon,<note place="margin">Lyford. p. <hi>101.</hi>
               </note> though it be but the formal act of one part: ſo in regard of this hypoſtatical union of two Natures in one perſon, the acts of each Nature are aſcribed to the perſon. Thus 'tis ſaid the Jews <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. <hi>i. e.</hi> they crucified that perſon who was the Lord of glory. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. God is ſaid to purchaſe his Church by his blood; as God he could not ſhed his blood, but 'twas that perſon who was God. Thus is Chriſt ſaid to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when he was on earth; <hi>i. e.</hi> as God, he was in heaven.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:119240:140"/> And ſo what is proper to each nature by reaſon of the hypoſtatical union, is aſcribed to the whole perſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This union of two natures in one perſon, is without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion or tranſmutation; the natures remaining diſtinct, and the properties and operations of both natures diſtinct, notwithſtanding this union. Some things are proper to the Godhead, of which the Manhood is uncapable; and ſome things proper to the Manhood, of which the Godhead is uncapable: We cannot ſay the Godhead was athirſt, weary, dyed; neither can we ſay the Manhood was the Fountain of all being, the Creator and Preſerver of all things; or that it is ubiquitary or omnipreſent, though we may ſay all of the ſame perſon. 'Tis obſerved by learned Writers, that the dividing of the perſon which is but one,<note place="margin">Hooker Eccleſ. Pol. p. <hi>299.</hi>
               </note> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of the natures which are two, hath occaſioned thoſe grand Errors in this Article of faith, by which the peace of the Church hath been ſo much diſturbed. And ſutably to theſe foure heads that have been ſpoken to, there have ariſen foure ſeveral hereſies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Arrians,</hi> denying the Deity of Chriſt, againſt whom the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> Determined that he was <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who divided Chriſt into two perſons, becauſe of his two natures,<note place="margin">

            <p>But in the foure above-named heads enough hath been ſaid by way of Antidote againſt thoſe dangerous miſtakes. And all being duly conſidered, we cannot but ſee great reaſon why he ſhould be called <hi>wonderful,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. Well might the Apoſtle cry out by way of admiration, <hi>Without controverſie great is the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of godlineſſe, God was manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:119240:140"/>5. The ſingular fitneſſe of Chriſt for this work of Mediation, ariſes from his being God-man in two natures, united in one perſon without Confuſion or Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Had he not been truly God, he had been too mean a perſon for ſo high an employment; it was God that had been offended, an infinite Majeſty that had been deſpiſed. The perſon therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing muſt have ſome equality with him to whom he interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Had the whole ſociety of perſevering Angels inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on mans behalf, it had been to little purpoſe; one Chriſt was infinitely more than all, and that becauſe he was truly God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Had he not been compleatly man, he had been no way ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of performing that indiſpenſibly neceſſary condition, upon which God was willing to be reconciled; <hi>viz.</hi> The ſatisfying of that righteous ſentence God had pronounced. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might be capable of dying, (which as God he could not) and that the juſtice of God might be ſatisfied in the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by which it had been offended, 'twas neceſſary he ſhould be man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had he not been God and man in one perſon, the ſufferings of his humane nature could not have derived that infinite value from the Divine nature.<note place="margin">Mediat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. Had he not been God-man without confuſion of natures; his Deity might either have advanced his humanity, above the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of ſuffering; or his humanity might have debaſed his Deity below the capability of meriting, which is no leſſe than blaſphemy to ima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine. And this is the firſt reaſon, the ſingular fitneſſe of Chriſt for this work, becauſe of the Dignity of his perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. The ſingular fitneſſe of Chriſt for this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in reſpect of the ſutableneſſe of his Offices. There is a threefold miſery upon all men, or a threefold bar to communion with God.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:119240:141"/>1. The guilt of their ſins which themſelves are never able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate, or ſatisfie for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The blindneſſe of their minds, the cure whereof is too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for any creature Phyſician.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their bondage and captivity to ſin and Satan, which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies too ſtrong for man to deal with. Sutably to theſe three great neceſſities, Jeſus Chriſt is anointed of God to a threefold Office, of a Prieſt, a Prophet, a King; the former of which Offices he exerciſes on our behalf to God, and the two laſt, from God to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Prieſtly Office of Chriſt is the great, the only relief we have againſt the guilt of ſin; the work of the Prieſthood conſiſted under the Law, chiefly of theſe two parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Satisfaction for the ſins of the people. <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18, 19, &amp;c.</item>
               <item>2. Interceſſion unto God on their behalf, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.12, 13.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Both which were verified in Chriſt <hi>our great high Prieſt,</hi> Hebr. 4.14. And hence it is that the Apoſtle encourages us <hi>to come with boldneſs</hi> unto the Throne of Grace, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.16. What was done by others Typically, was done by Chriſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His ſatisfaction in diſcharging thoſe debts which his people had run into with Divine juſtice to the utmoſt farthing, and this he did by offering up that one ſingle ſacrifice which was infinitely more worth than all thoſe multitudes of ſacrifices offered up of old, and from which all former ſacrifices had their vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.2.</note> The Prieſts of old offered up creatures, but this high Prieſt offers up himſelf; they offered the blood of Bullocks, &amp;c. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.13, 14. but Chriſt the blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. They offered many ſacrifices, and Chriſt but one, but ſuch a one as infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all their many; ſuch a one as perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.14. One Sun is worth more than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Stars, and one Jewel than millions of ordinary ſtones; and ſo one Chriſt is more effectual than all <hi>Lebanon,</hi> or <hi>the cattel on a thouſand hills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:119240:141"/>2. His interceſſion; this is the other part of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office; his ſatisfaction, that was performed on earth; his Interceſſion is performed chiefly in heaven: by the former he purchaſed pardon and Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. compared with Verſe 21. by the latter he applies the benefits he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed; his ſufferings, though they were but while he was on earth, yet the benefit of them extends to all ages of the Church, both before and ſince his paſſion; and his Interceſſion is that which ſues out theſe bleſſings for his people; and therefore that great Apoſtle joynes both together as the foundation of all his comfort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Chriſt hath died, who ſtill makes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion;</hi> and both theſe are ſo full, ſo ſufficient a relief againſt the guilt of ſin, that as we have no other, ſo we need no other; as the High Prieſts bore the names of the people before the Lord, ſo does Jeſus Chriſt the names of his Elect;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.25. Heb. 9.12.24. Heb. 10.12. Heb. 11.25. 1 John 2.1.</note> but the High Prieſts of Old, were at certain times only to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, once a yeare to enter into the holy place; but Chriſt our ſpiritual High Prieſt, is not only <hi>entered,</hi> but <hi>ſat down at the</hi> right hand of God, to negotiate conſtantly on his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches behalf; <hi>He ever lives to make Interceſſion,</hi> Heb. 11:25. And beſides the conſtancy, conſider the prevalency of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; that God that regards the cry of Ravens, that will not altogether neglect the humiliation of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that God that is ſo ready to anſwer and honour the prayers of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cannot but much more regard the prayers of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, praying by his blood, and praying for nothing more than what himſelf hath deſerved and purchaſed. He that is ſuch a great High Prieſt, is excellently fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in reſpect of this Office, for the work of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Prophetical Office of Chriſt, is the great,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.15. Joh. 1.24, 25, 45. John 6.14.</note> the only relief we have againſt the blindneſſe and ignorance of our mindes. He is that great Prophet of his Church whom <hi>Moſes</hi> fore-told, the Jews expected, and all men need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that Sun of Righteouſneſſe, who by his glorious beams diſpels thoſe miſts of ignorance and errour, which darken the mindes of men, and is therefore ſtiled by way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, <hi>that light,</hi> John 1.8. and <hi>the true light,</hi> Joh. 1.9.</p>
            <pb n="255" facs="tcp:119240:142"/>
            <p>The execution of this Prophetical Office, is partly by revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo much of the Will of God as was neceſſary to our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, partly by making thoſe revelations powerful and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In revealing the Will of God; for <hi>no man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father, he hath declared him,</hi> Joh. 1.18. The manner of revealing the mind of God, hath been different in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes making uſe of inſtruments; who were either ordinary; as under the Law, the Prieſts whoſe <hi>lips</hi> ſhould <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve knowledge;</hi> and under the Goſpel, Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:<note place="margin">Mal. 2.7. 2 Chron. 15.3. Eph. 4.11, 12, 13.</note> Or elſe extraordinary; as Prophets under the Law; and Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, in the firſt plantation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For ſometime inſtructing his Church immediately in his own perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In enlightening effectually the ſouls of his people: in cauſing the blinde to ſee, and <hi>making them who were once dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be light in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 5.2. Thus he inſtructs by his Word, and by his Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. and by that Soveraignty he hath over the hearts of men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens their hearts to receive his counſels. He that can thus ſpeak, not only to the eare, but to the heart, is alſo in this Office, excellently fitted for the work of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Kingly Office of Chriſt, is the great, the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief we have againſt our bondage to ſin and Satan. He to whom <hi>all power is given in heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.18. Eph. 1.20, 21, 22. Heb. 2.8. Phil. 2 9, 10, 11. 1 Cor. 15.27, 28. Iſa 61.1.</note> 
               <hi>and in earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. He whom God hath raiſed from the dead, and ſet at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church: It is he that reſtores <hi>liberty to the captives,</hi> and <hi>opens the Priſon</hi> doors <hi>to them that are bound.</hi> This great Office of a King, he executes chiefly in theſe Royal acts.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:119240:142"/>1. In gathering to himſelf a people out of all kindreds,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10. Iſa 55.4, 5. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. 1 Pet. 1.3, 5.

            <p n="2">2. In governing that people by Laws, Officers, and Cenſures of his own ordaining, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 33.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17, 18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In bringing all his elect into a ſtate of ſaving grace, and preſerving that grace alive in their ſoules, which himſelf hath wrought, though it be as a ſpark of fire in an Ocean of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in carrying it on to perfection, and crowning it with glory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In reſtraining, over-ruling, and at laſt deſtroying all his and his Churches enemies, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 110.1. thoſe who will not ſubmit to the Scepter of his grace, he rules with his <hi>Iron rod,</hi> and will at laſt <hi>daſh them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel,</hi> Pſal. 2.9.</p>
            <p>And thus is Chriſt not only in reſpect of the dignity of his perſon, but the ſuitableneſſe of his Offices, the only fit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and man.</p>
            <p>The doctrinal part of this Scripture being thus cleared, take one word by way of application.</p>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. He ſtoop't down <hi>to become a man;</hi> he left the warme bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of his Father, and took himſelf lodgings in the womb of a Virgin; he ſtrip't himſelf of his Robes of glory, to put on the courſe home-ſpun, and thread-bare tatters of a fraile humanity; and he that <hi>thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an eſtate lower than ſome of his own creatures; this is the firſt Riddle in the Apoſtles great myſtery of godlineſſe: <hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi> And ſure,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> that the moſt magnificent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the world ſhould become a Toad, that the whole Hoſt of Angels ſhould be degraded into worms; that this goodly frame of

               <hi>and was made in the likeneſs of men,</hi> Ver. 6. He emptied himſelf of his credit; to become a man was ſo much beneath him, that upon the matter it undid him in point of reputation. The greateſt ſtep of Chriſts humiliation, was his Incarnation; for that being man he ſhould dye, is nothing ſo aſtoniſhing a wonder, and inconceivable, as that being God he ſhould be made a <hi>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He condeſcended to <hi>put his neck under the yoke of the Law. God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſent forth his ſon made of a woman;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> and though that be very much, yet there is more added, <hi>made under the Law.</hi> Though every man that is born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, every mothers childe among us, be neceſſarily ſubject to a Law, and it is no condeſcention, its no whit below the greateſt Prince on earth that gives Laws to many thouſands; yet this was a very great ſubmiſſion in Chriſt. <hi>Adam</hi> while he continued in a ſtate of integrity and perfection, was then under a Law, and did not yield or abate any thing of his right by it; the bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels continue under an obligation to obedience, and they do not by this loſe any of their birth-right for a creature; as a creature, is indiſpenſably ſubjected to the Law of its Maker, by vertue of its creatureſhip and dependance; and ſhould any one of them attempt a diſobligation, it were an eſſay toward a prodigious and praeternatural Antinomianiſme. But the Son of God, the Eternal and Independent Law-maker did admirably abaſe himſelf, to come under the obediential obſervance, and poyſonous maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Law, upon which there was only the print of his own authoririty; for though the humane nature abſtractly conſidered, is as a creature bound to the obſervance of a Law, yet being in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, and aſſumed into the perſonality of the Son of God, it was exempted from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and indemnified as to curſe and penalty. Chriſt ſubmitted to the Ceremonial Law in his circumciſion, put his neck under the yoke of the moral Law, to fulfill the preceptive part by his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:119240:145"/> Perfect obedience, and ſatisfie the maledictive part by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſufferings; all which ſubjection was not a debt that God could have challenged of him, but a pure voluntary ſubſcription; <hi>The Law is not made</hi> in ſome ſenſe <hi>for a righteous man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.9.</note> but it is not made in any ſenſe for the glorious God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And which is a ſtep beneath both theſe; he <hi>appeared as a ſinful man, or in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> ſubjection to the Law made him very low, but the ſimilitude of ſin, which is the violation of the Law was a far greater abaſement.

Sin was neither inherent in him, nor committed by him; but imputed to him. Sin never defiled him, but it defaced him; he had nothing of its impurity, but much of its penalty; he was not tainted with that plague, but he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take upon him the tokens. In the ſame Chapter the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tells us, <hi>He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth, and he was numbred with Tranſgreſſors.</hi>

What kinde of death Chriſt humbled himſelf unto; and this I cannot omit, the Apoſtle having added ſuch a remarkable Emphaſis by way of reduplication; <hi>Death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> It was not only a violent death, and there's much in that, that he dyed not a natural, but a violent death: Nor indeed could he, both becauſe there was no ſin in him to be the in-let of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, nor would that have been ſatisfactory for the ſin of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               <hi>not accepting deliverance,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) the incomes and ſupports of Divine Grace, made an abatement of their pains; oh but what ſhall we ſay of the bitterneſſe of that death, where the Author of all their ſtrength, God and man bewrayes paſſions? how much dregs was there in that Cup which Chriſt was ſo loth to drink of?</p>
            <p>Three things made Chriſts death ſo exceeding painful.</p>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 22.16.</note> was the Prophetical complaint of the Pſalmiſt, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing that addeth much to the pain of Chriſts death, was the <hi>extenſion and diſtortion of his body;</hi> the Croſſe was a rack to him, and he was ſtretch't as upon the Tenters; for when any perſons were to be crucified, the Croſſe you muſt underſtand, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 22 17.</note> he was ſo rack't, that his bones were almoſt ready to ſtart out of the skin.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:119240:147"/>3. The death of Chriſt was more painful, by reaſon of its <hi>ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and gradual approach.</hi> Chriſt was from the third,<note place="margin">Compare Mar. 15.25. with 34.</note> to the ninth houre in dying; from nine in the morning, till three in the afternoon, ſix compleat houres—When bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants would make any mans death more than ordinarily pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they have deviſed wayes to cauſe a lingring death; and when news was once brought to one of them, that ſuch a one was dead ſuddenly, he cryed out, <hi>Evaſit,</hi> he hath made an eſcape. When death comes, the ſlower its pace, the heavier its tread; the longer the Seige, the fiercer the ſtorme; but this is true of Chriſt, more than others; for when they are long in dying, they uſually faint, and their ſpirits abate, they are brought ſtep by ſtep to deaths doore, and dead before death; but with Chriſt it was otherwiſe, he ſtood all that while in perfect ſtrength; the vigour and acuteneſſe of his ſenſes was no whit blunted, or made leſſe ſenſible of paine. That is a notable Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.37, 39. <hi>Jeſus cryed with a loud voice, and gave up the Ghost; and when the Centurion, which stood ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r againſt him, ſaw that he ſo cryed out, and gave up the Ghoſt, he ſaid, Truly this man was the Son of God;</hi> a very ſtrange inference, this man dyes, and gives up the Ghoſt, and therefore he is the Son of God. The Argument one would think, were ſtrong to the contrary; but here lies the ſtrength of his reaſon, When he ſaw he ſo cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and died, he ſaid he was the Son of God. He very well knew, that in other men ſtrength abated leiſurely, their ſpeech grew low, and they uſed to fumble and falter, and rattle in the throat; but as for this man, he gave ſuch a cry at the laſt gaſp as he never heard, and thereupon infers, Truly he was the Son of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another bitter ingredient unto the death of Chriſt was <hi>ſhame;</hi> and this was much more than the former. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſharp and cutting, ſo intolerable to an ingenuous and noble ſpirit as ſhame. The paine of an hundred deaths, is more eaſily undergone by ſuch, than the reproach of one. Now in this reſpect, the thieves fared much better than he did; we read of no irriſion, no inſcription, no taunts, or ſarcaſms caſt upon them; they had only paine to encounter; Chriſt both pain and ſcorne; the ſouldiers, the Jews, the very thieves flouted him. <hi>He endured the Croſſe,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.12.</note> 
               <hi>that he might ſanctifie the people with his own Blood, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without the Gate;</hi> which in the next verſe he explaines, and calls <hi>his reproach;</hi> as under the Law, the Blaſphemer was by Gods appointment to be ſtoned without the Camp; and amongſt us at this day,<note place="margin">Levit. 24.14.</note> the moſt baſe and villainous Malefactors are carted away to <hi>Tyburne,</hi> and not executed upon <hi>Tower hill,</hi> that is honourable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſting of Chriſts death is yet behind, it was invenom'd with <hi>a curſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 21.23.</note> though pain be bad, and ſhame worſe, yet the curſe is worſt of all. <hi>He that is hanged, is accurſed of God.</hi> That was (it is true) a Ceremonial Curſe, but it was typical, and had ſpecial relation to Chriſt, who was under a real, moral curſe; and ſo it is applyed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Christ hath Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the curſe of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>being made a curſe for us; for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:119240:148"/> And here the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> puts a remarkable accent, ſpeaking of Chriſt to the Jewes, <hi>Whom ye ſlew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5.30.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>and hang d on a Tree;</hi> intimating that bare ſlaying him, would not have been ſo much as hanging him on a tree; the Jews had many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes of putting people to death, as ſtoning, ſtrangling, burning, beheading, but only crucifying had a curſe annexed to it. Chriſt was made ſin for us, that we might meet with, and intercept that wrath and curſe that was due to us, and breaking out upon us. We read in the ſtory of his paſſion, that when Chriſt was going to wreſtle with that dreadful agony in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>he paſſed over the brook Cedron.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 18.1.</note> And if we conſult the Hiſtory of the Kings, we ſhall finde that when any godly ones amongſt them, as <hi>Hezekiah, Aſa, Joſiah,</hi> reformed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the City and Temple of Idolatry, they caſt the abominable and curſed things into the brook <hi>Kidron.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.16.29.16.30.14. Pſal. 110. ult.</note> Chriſt was in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to <hi>drink of the brook in the way,</hi> to paſſe over, and wade through a River full of curſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In what manner Chriſt underwent this death. It behooves us to conſider the manner of our performing duties to Chriſt, for their acceptation; and it will be worth the while for us to ponder the manner of Chriſts ſhedding his blood for us; both for our conſolation and imitation.</p>
            <p>Now as to the manner of his death, three circumſtances call for our conſideration.</p>

            <p>If you view Chriſt in the words before going, you will behold the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> ecclipſed; but in this Text you will ſee him ſhining forth in his ſtrength and ſplendour.</p>

            <p>The Doctrine of Chriſts Humiliation leads you to Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> but this Doctrine will lead you to Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> to Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There you may ſee Chriſt ſtanding at the Bar, but here you ſee him ſitting on a Throne of Majeſty and glory.</p>
            <p>The former Doctrine ſhews you the Son of man in <hi>the forme of a ſervant,</hi> but this repreſents Chriſt to you the Son of God like himſelf, in the glorious eſtate of Triumphant Majeſty.</p>
            <p>You have heard how <hi>Christ died for our ſins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4.25. Rom. 5.10.</note> and how we are <hi>Reconciled by his death;</hi> and now you ſhall heare how he roſe <hi>for our juſtification,</hi> and how we are <hi>ſaved by his</hi> life.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Humiliation</hi> there was neither <hi>form, nor beauty,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In Chriſts Humiliation you heare how he was reproached in his Perſon, Name, Doctrine, Miniſtry, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; but he is now exalted, and hath a <hi>name given him above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas in his Humiliation his enemies <hi>bowed the knee in ſcorne</hi> to him, yet in his Exaltation they muſt bow the knee with fear and trembling. Then they cried after Chriſt, <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, crucifie him;</hi> but God hath exalted him ſo, as <hi>every tongue muſt confeſs that Jeſus is the Lord,</hi> to the glory of God.</p>
            <p>And thus Contraries are illuſtrated by their contraries; the ſufferings of Chriſt (like a dark ſhadow to a curious picture,<note place="margin">Contraria <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Before we come to the Doctrine of Chriſts Exaltation, we will a little conſider the connexion of theſe three Verſes with the three preceding Verſes, <hi>viz.</hi> 6, 7, 8.— where it is ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>being in the forme of God, and thought it not Robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men, and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the death of the Croſs; wherefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And that which favours this Explication, is that ſaying of the Apoſtle concerning Chriſt;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2,</note> 
               <hi>That for the joy that was ſet before him, he endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> as if having an <hi>eye to the Recompence of the Reward,</hi> enabled Chriſt to perſevere with more patience, when he became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it derogate from the freeneſs of Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that he was rewarded for them; for even that glory that Chriſt hath in heaven, is for our good and comfort. Nor was it out of indigence and neceſſity, that Chriſt accepts of glory in a way of <hi>Reward</hi> of his obedience; but herein he <hi>commended his love</hi> the more to us, that would ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend, and ſo far even in his <hi>Exaltation humble himſelf,</hi> to receive glory in the way of obedience, which he might have challenged by vertue of his perſonal union.

            <p n="4">4. It is fit to be conſidered, that the glory which Chriſt hath in Heaven, in ſitting at the right hand of God, is ſuch, that it cannot be merited by the ſufferings of the Humane nature of Chriſt. And therefore it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I will not here undertake to determine the Queſtion; I find it the judgement of ſome of our Learned Divines,<note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. For if we look upon Jeſus Chriſt as rewarded for his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for us, we may thence be aſſured, that our ſufferings for him (though of another nature) <hi>ſhall be eternally rewarded.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Or if you note the order only, that Jeſus Chriſt was firſt humbled, and then exalted, we may thence learn that <hi>before honour is humility,</hi>

            <p>It is very Remarkable how the ſteps of Chriſts Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation did punctually anſwer to the ſteps of his Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>There were three ſteps by which Jeſus Chriſt deſcended in his voluntary Humiliation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.16. 2 Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13. Gal. 4.4. Heb. 7.22. 1 Cor. 5.7.</note>Firſt, <hi>His Incarnation,</hi> by which he was <hi>made of a woman,</hi> and ſo <hi>became man;</hi> he <hi>was made ſinne,</hi> and ſo became out <hi>Surety;</hi> he was made <hi>a Curſe,</hi> and ſo became our <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> This was the largeſt ſtep of Chriſts Deſcenſion and Humiliation; for it was more for the <hi>Son of God</hi> to become the <hi>Son of man,</hi> than for the Son of man to die, and being dead, to be buried, and being buried, to continue in the ſtate of the dead, and under the power of death untill the Third Day.</p>
            <p>Anſwerable to this degree of his Humiliation, was his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;</hi> for as by his Incarnation he was manifeſt in the fleſh,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.3, 4.</note> the ſon of man, <hi>made of the ſeed of David according to the fleſh,</hi> ſo <hi>by his Reſurrection from the dead, he was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the Son of God, with power according to the Spirit of holineſs.</hi> The Reſurrection of Chriſt was the firſt ſtep of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, <hi>He was declared to be the Son of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Clarificatio Chriſti ab ejus reſurrectione ſumpſit exordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Son of God, even during the <hi>dayes of his fleſh;</hi> but then he was openly declared to be the Sonne of God, that he could by his own Almighty Power, <hi>raiſe</hi> up the <hi>Temple</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> which the Jewes had <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond ſtep of Chriſts Humiliation, was his poor, painful, and contemptible life, and his painful, ſhameful, and curſed death of the Croſs;<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> 
               <hi>He was found in the form of a Servant.</hi> He was deſpiſed in his Perſon, Miniſtry, and Miracles in <hi>the dayes of his fleſh;</hi> that is, whilſt he lived here upon earth. He was <hi>poor in estate, followed</hi> by the poor; he had not <hi>where to lay his head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.5. Mat. 8.20.</note> he was reproached, and counted a <hi>Sabbath-breaker,</hi> a <hi>wine-bibb r,</hi> an <hi>enemy to Caeſar,</hi> a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> he was counted every thing but what he was.</p>
            <p>Anſwerable to this great Exinanition of Chriſt, is his aſcenſion into Heaven, <hi>and ſitting at the right hand of God.</hi> Man did not ſo deſpiſe and diſparage, but God hath honoured him, to <hi>ſit
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:119240:161"/> on the right hand of God;</hi> note the great honour that Jeſus Chriſt is inveſted withal; as he was man,<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.5.</note> ſo he was <hi>lower than the Angels;</hi> But in that he hath ſaid unto him, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand,</hi> he hath e xalted him above the Angels; for <hi>to none of the Angels hath he ſaid at any time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.1.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art my Sonne, Sit thou on my right hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To ſit at Gods right hand,</hi> is to be next in dignity and honour unto Almighty God; and this is that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, ſhowing how God <hi>raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.13. Eph. 1.20, 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>far above all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus all the diſhonour and reproach that was caſt upon Chriſt in his life, and the ignominy of his ſhameful, painful, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death of the Croſs is now taken away by Chriſt his aſcending up into heaven, ſitting at Gods right hand,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.</note> and all <hi>the Angels of God worſhipping him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus our Lord Jeſus was exalted from a death of ſhame, to a life of glory, and that not to a temporary, but an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Chriſt was raiſed up, not as <hi>Lazarus</hi> to die againe, but Chriſt died <hi>but once,</hi> but <hi>lives for ever at the right hand of God to make Interceſſion.</hi> So ſpeaketh Chriſt of himſelf,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.10.

For the further Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Doctrine of Chriſts Exaltation, let us conſider the particulars thereof, as they are contained in this Scripture, and they are theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hath given him a name above every name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That every knee, of things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and things on the earth, and things under the earth, ſhall bow to the Name of Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That every tongue muſt confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is the Lord.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe we will enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What we are to underſtand by the Name given unto Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How this Name is a Name above every Name?</p>

               </note>2.

            <p>Secondly, Others, as <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> do think, that in, that Chriſt was called the <hi>S nne of God,</hi> he had therein a name above every name; and this Expoſition is gathered from that paſſage of the Apoſtle, that Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>much better than the Angels, as he hath by Inheritance obtain'd a more excellent name than they; for unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though this be true, that to be the eternal Son of God, is a Name above every Name, yet this cannot be meant here, for it is ſpoken of that which Chriſt was exalted to after his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; but from Eternity he was the Sonne of God, and did not ceaſe to be ſo by his Incarnation and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>

            <p n="1">1, Sometimes in Scripture-phraſe, Name is put for glory and Renown. So we read of men of Renown, it is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Men of Name, and of <hi>famous men,</hi> Heads of the Houſe of their Fathers. What we read <hi>famous men,</hi> is in the Hebrew, <hi>Men of Names;</hi> and thus the glory which Chriſt is inveſted withal, is <hi>the Glory of the only begotten of the Father.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:119240:163"/>2. By Name in Scripture-phraſe, is meant power, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Soveraignty by which Chriſt is <hi>King of</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and King of Saints; and thus the Scripture ſpeaks; <hi>The works</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that I do in my Fathers Name,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>How hath Chriſt obtained a Name above every Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Nomen ſuper omne nomen,</hi> a Name above every Name, is a demonſtration of Chriſts Super-Exaltation, and it notes four things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>This is a Name above every Name, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be the only Saviour of the World,</hi> that his Name ſhould be the <hi>Only One</hi> Name by which we are ſaved.</p>

               <hi>Thou</hi> (O Lord) <hi>deliveredſt thy people into the hands of their enemies who vexed them, and in the time of their trouble, when they cryed unto thee, thou heardeſt them from heaven, and according to thy manifold mercies, thou gaveſt them Saviours who ſaved them out of the hand of their Enemies.</hi> Such a Saviour was <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians, Joſhua</hi> from the <hi>Canaanites, Gideon</hi> from the <hi>Midianites, Jeptha</hi> from the <hi>Ammorites,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon</hi> from the <hi>Philiſtims;</hi> but all theſe were but partial, petty, and temporal Saviours. Theſe ſaved the body from miſery, and that but for a time; Chriſt ſaves our ſouls <hi>from our ſins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> and that for ever. <hi>All theſe Saviours</hi> ſtood in need of <hi>the Saviour. Joſhua</hi> himſelf had eternally periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had it not been for <hi>Jeſus</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>the only Saviour,</hi> to whoſe moſt precious and <hi>ſaving Name,</hi> all the Old Teſtament pointed at. He was <hi>the Saviour</hi> in whom all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> were performed, all the <hi>Types</hi> accompliſhed, and all the <hi>Propheſies</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt hath a <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> in that he is exalted to ſit <hi>at the Right hand of God,</hi> which is a Name or honour which never the Angels nor Arch-Angels had. This I prove from that paſſage of the Apoſtle in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where it is ſaid concerning Chriſt; <hi>Who having purged our ſinnes, is ſate down on the Right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He hath a Name above every Name,</hi> becauſe it is through <hi>this Name,</hi> that <hi>the Name of God</hi> becomes a comfort unto us. The <hi>Attributes of God,</hi> are the <hi>Name of God;</hi> Now without an Intereſt in Chriſt, we ſhall have no comfort in any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God.</p>
            <p>To a Chriſtleſs ſinner, all the Attributes of God are againſt him; as for inſtance,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God is wiſe;</hi> that's the worſe for a wicked man; for he knows all that wickedneſs thine own <hi>heart</hi> is privy to, and much more evil by thee,<note place="margin">Jer. 17.10. 1 Joh. 3.20.</note> than thine <hi>own heart</hi> knoweth.</p>

            <p>All the thoughts of God muſt needs be terrible to all thoſe ſouls that are out of Chriſt.</p>

The Humane Nature of Chriſt being a Creature, cannot be capable of Divine Worſhip, or of ſitting at the right hand of God. But the Humane Nature of Chriſt by the perſonal inſeparable union it hath to his Divine Nature, is thus advanced.</p>
            <p>Having finiſhed the firſt particular of Chriſts Exaltation, that God hath given him a Name above every Name; I now proceed,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another particular of Chriſts <hi>Exaltation,</hi> is this, <hi>That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow;</hi> In the handling of which, I will endeavour to reſolve theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What are we to underſtand here by bowing the knee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some take this literally, as the Papiſts, who in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip bow the knee as often as they heare the Name of Jeſus menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. The Learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> is of an opinion, that ſome of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in uſe amongſt the Papiſts, might have an innocent Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal;
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:119240:166"/> as their ſigning with the Croſs, to ſhow that they were not aſhamed of the Croſs of Chriſt, with which the Heathens did reproach them; and ſo the ſtanding up at the Creed, to note their reſolution to ſtrive together for the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints. So genuflection to the Name of Jeſus, was (ſay ſome) in oppoſition to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who denyed the Divinity of Chriſt; but whether theſe things were ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent at the firſt; ſeeing they are all of humane inſtitution, and have been abuſed to ſuperſtition, we have juſtly laid the uſe of them aſide. And this Text cannot be ſo underſtood; for if by <hi>Name</hi> we underſtand the power of Chriſt, then by bowing the knee, muſt be meant our ſubmiſſion and ſubjection to this power.</p>
            <p>By bowing, therefore, to the Name of Jeſus, is underſtood that obedience and ſubjection which is due to the Soveraign power and Auhority of Chriſt. Thus when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was exalted to that Dignity and Authority in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 41.43. Joh. 5.22, 23. Mat. 28.18.

All power</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is given me, both in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> He is the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> and the <hi>Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> to whom all obedience, ſervice and ſubjection is moſt due.</p>

            <p>In one ſtory we finde that the Devils did three times proſtrate themſelves at the feet of Chriſt. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> relates the Story of the man poſſeſſed with a Legion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>

            <p>Hence it is ſaid that the <hi>Devils tremble,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2.19.</note> becauſe they know Chriſt as their Judge, but not as their Saviour. They muſt bow, becauſe they cannot help it.</p>

            <p n="1">1. To this is anſwered, that even the Devils of Hell are <hi>bound to bow the knee unto Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though like wicked Rebels they have refuſed to do it. And ſo much we gather from that Anſwer of Chriſt to the Devil, who when he had the impudence

            <p>Secondly, By its inſtrument, that is, <hi>the blood of the Croſs by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The object of it, which are, <hi>All things, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven:</hi> By which learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Davenant</hi> underſtands the Angels ſpoken of as the things in heaven; and ſo many others, ſuppoſing that the Elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> confirmed in their eſtate by Chriſt: But with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to better judgements, I conceive</p>
            <p n="1">1. that there is not ſufficient evidence in Scripture, to ſhew that the holy Angels had their confirmation from Chriſt; nor doth it ſeem to be neceſſary; foraſmuch as it is commonly acknowledged, that <hi>Adam</hi> (who was under the ſame Covenant with the Angels) if he had continued in the obſervation of Gods precepts; for ſo long time as God judged meet, he ſhould have been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vertue of the Covenant of Works ſome other way. And therefore it was rather to be thought, that the Angels have their confirmatiom from Chriſt, as God and Head over all things, than as Mediatour (The actions of Chriſt as Mediatour, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a breach, according to that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>A M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour is not a Mediatour of one; i. e.</hi> of two parties which are one politically; <hi>i. e.</hi> which are agreed in one, but of parties at variance.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. Howſoever if the Angels had been confirmed by Chriſt, yet ſurely they were not reconciled by Chriſt; for Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation implies a former enmity, as theſe things in heaven are ſaid to be. And therefore I rather underſtand it of departed Saints, Patriarchs, Prophets, &amp;c. who, as they went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not to any <hi>Limbus;</hi> ſo this expreſſion is uſed to inſinuate,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:119240:174"/> that they were ſaved by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, even as we, as it is, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.11. and that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt did expiate not only thoſe ſins which were committed after his death, but thoſe alſo which were long ſince paſt; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. as <hi>Sol non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum conspictus illuminat orbem,</hi> The light and influence of the Sun is diſperſed among us, before the body of the Sun doth appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Horizon.</p>
            <p>So then here you have mans Reconciliation, Juſtification, and Salvation deſcribed, together with the procuring cauſe of it, ſet forth</p>
            <p n="1">1. More generally, <hi>By him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. More ſpecially, <hi>By the blood of his Croſs,</hi> by the ſhedding of his blood for us, by his death and paſſion complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Croſs.</p>
            <p>The doctrine I intend to handle, is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the death of Jeſus Christ is the procuring cauſe of mans juſtification and ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt all thoſe hereſies which God hath ſuffered to ſpring among us (that they that are approved, may be manifeſt) none are more dangerous than thoſe which concern the perſon and office of Chriſt; of thoſe many ſtreams of errour which run into the dead Sea of Socinianiſm, theſe are two; They deny the Godhead, and the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and ſo indeed ſubvert the whole Fabrick of the Goſpel. This latter I ſhall here endeavour to diſcuſs, and ſhall proceed in this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall explain it. 2. Aſſert. 3. Defend. 4. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Explication of this great Goſpel-myſtery, (which truly if it fall, we are without hope, and ſo of all creatures moſt miſerable) I ſhall lay down theſe ſteps.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God made the world and man in it for his own ſervice and glory: And this end he cannot be diſappointed in, but muſt have it one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Man by ſin thwharted Gods end, and caſt dirt upon his glory, and ſo doth every ſinner: Every ſin is a refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon Gods Name, a blot in Gods Government of the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:119240:175"/> world; ſo that ſome make it a pretence for their Atheiſm, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That if there were a God, he would not ſuffer ſin to be in the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God is inclined by his Nature, and obliged by his intereſt, to hate ſin, and puniſh the ſinner, and ſo to recover his glory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay God is inclined by his nature, to hate and puniſh ſin; I do not poſitively conclude, that he is abſolutely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; I ſhall not here meddle with that nice queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God was ſo far obliged to puniſh it by his nature, that he could not pardon ſin without ſatisfaction; but this is manifeſt: look upon man as a ſinner, and ſo Gods Nature muſt needs be oppoſite unto him; The Scripture deſcribes God in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not only in regard of his Will, but alſo in reſpect of his Nature, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity, &amp;c. Exod.</hi> 34.6. where the nature of the Divine Majeſty is repreſented; among other parts of the deſcription this is one, He will by no meanes clear the guilty. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 11.5. <hi>The wicked—his ſoul hateth;</hi> —and the reaſon is added from Gods Nature, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>For the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſſe, his countenance doth behold the upright.</hi> And it may further appear, that here puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin is not an act of Gods Will, but of his Nature. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Actions of Gods Will are only known by Revelation, not by reaſon, or the light of Nature; but that God ſhould and would puniſh ſin, this was known by natures light, to ſuch as were unacquainted with Revelation-light. Hence came the Concluſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4. <hi>(This man is a Murderer, whom though he hath eſcaped the Sea, yet <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>engeance ſuffereth him not to live.)</hi> Vengeance, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſuppoſed Goddeſſe, but indeed nothing elſe but Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is obliged by his intereſt to puniſh him, as he is the Ruler of the world. By ſin there comes a double miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is wronged.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The world is wronged by a bad example, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſin; ſo that if God might pardon ſin as it is a wrong to himſelf, yet he is in a manner obliged to puniſh it to right the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119240:175"/> wronged world, and to make ſuch ſinners patterns of ſeverity, that the world may not make them examples of ungodlineſſe; even as King <hi>James</hi> might pardon the Powder-Traytors, ſo far forth as his Perſon was concerned; but if you look on it as a wrong to the whole Nation, to the Proteſtant Religion, ſo he was obliged to puniſh them, to make them warnings to others in the like caſes; ſo that you ſee mans puniſhment was neceſſary for Gods glory, and the Worlds good.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The puniſhment to be inflicted, muſt be ſutable to ſins Nature, and Gods Majeſty; and therefore an infinite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this is juſtice to obſerve an exact proportion between ſin and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The only way whereby this puniſhment might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and yet man ſaved, was by the incarnation and paſſion of God-man. Man being every other way finite, muſt have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered infinitely in regard of duration, even to eternity. And none but Chriſt who was infinite in regard of the ſubject, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his perſon, as he was God, could have ſo ſpeedily and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually delivered us from this puniſhment, by ſuffering it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whereby Gods juſtice was ſatisfied, his hatred againſt the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner removed, and his mercy at liberty to act in the pardon of the ſinner.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, God was graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accept for us, and impute to us, as if we had ſuffered in our perſons, and ſo he receives us into mercy. And this is the ſubſtance of the Doctrine of the Goſpel about mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So much for the firſt thing, the Explication of the point.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I now come to the Aſſertion or Demonſtration of it, that you may receive this Doctrine as a Truth, not built upon the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, but revealed in the Word of God. Now to prove this point; <hi>viz. That the death of Jeſus Chriſt is the procuring cauſe of mans Justification and Salvation,</hi> I may uſe two ſorts of Arguments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some from the conſideration of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Some from the conſideration of mans Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:119240:176"/>1. From the conſideration of Chriſts death I ſhall offer ſix Arguments.
<list>
                  <item>1. Its Poſſibility.</item>
                  <item>2. Neceſſity.</item>
                  <item>3. Nature.</item>
                  <item>4. Cauſe.</item>
                  <item>5. Vicegerency.</item>
                  <item>6. Peculiarity.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, From the poſſibility: Let me be bold to aſſert; had it not been for this purpoſe, it had not been poſſible for Chriſt to dye; as it was <hi>not poſſible</hi> for Chriſt <hi>to be holden of death,</hi> Acts 2.24. the price being paid, and ſo the Priſoner of courſe to be releaſed; ſo it had not been poſſible, becauſe not juſt <hi>(Id tantum poſsumus, quod jure poſſumus)</hi> to put him into a priſon, if it had not been to pay a debt. And a debt of his own he had none, he was <hi>a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. <hi>Holy, blameleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Hebr. 7.26. <hi>He knew no ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. which I the rather mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cinus</hi> hath the impudence to lay down this blaſphemous Aſſertion, That Chriſt, like the Jewiſh High Prieſt, did offer for himſelf as well as for the people. You have ſeen he had no debt, no ſin of his own, (he profeſſeth of himſelf that he did <hi>alwayes thoſe things which pleaſed his Father,</hi> John 8.29.) and therefore he muſt needs dye for our debts; it is plain that <hi>Adam,</hi> had he continued in integrity, ſhould not have dyed; death is not the effect of nature; (then the Saints in glory muſt dye again; for they have the ſame nature) but the fruit of ſin; <hi>death entred into the world by ſin;</hi> Rom. 5.12. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proves the ſin of Infants (expreſſed by that Periphraſis, <hi>ſuch as have not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion</hi>) from the death of Infants; and in <hi>Adam</hi> all dyed; <hi>i. e.</hi> by his ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. Therefore Jeſus Chriſt being purified from the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, by his holy birth, and no leſſe perfect than <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have been, could never have dyed, if not for our ſakes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the neceſſity of Chriſts death; it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for our Salvation and Juſtification, without which end it had been in vain. The <hi>Socinians</hi> mention two other reaſons and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:119240:176"/> ends of Chriſts death; the one to be an example of obedience; <hi>but ſuch we have many others upon far leſs charge;</hi> the other to be a ground of hope for the remiſſion of ſin, and the fulfilling of Gods promiſes; <hi>but properly it is not the death, but reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, which is the ground of our hope,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.14. <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, your faith is vain;</hi> ſo that thoſe ends are improper and inſufficient: And to ſtrike it dead, I urge but one place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. — <hi>If righteouſneſſe come by the Law, Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> What can be more plain, if righteouſneſſe be not by Chriſt, that the death of Chriſt be not the procuring cauſe of our Juſtification, Chriſt is dead in vain, to no end, or (as <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others rather underſtand) without any meritorious cauſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> our ſins; however all comes to one.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From the nature of Chriſts death, it is a Sacrifice; this conſiſts of two Branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sacrifices did expiate ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſts death is a Sacrifice, and a ſin-expiating Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay Sacrifices did expiate ſin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He ſhall put his hands upon the head of the burnt-offering, and it ſhall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him;</hi> and many ſuch places. And this they did typically, (which ſtrengthens the cauſe we have in hand) as repreſenting and fore-ſignifying Chriſt, without which it was <hi>not poſſible for the blood of Buls and Goats to take away ſins,</hi> Hebr. 10.4. And the ſins pardoned under the Old Teſtament, were pardoned thorough Chriſt, and not through any vertue of their Sacrifices, Chriſt being <hi>a Mediatour for the Redemption of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament,</hi> Hebrewes 9.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And this brings in the ſecond Head, that Chriſts death is a Sacrifice, and a ſin-expiating Sacrifice, if either the names or nature of it may be regarded; for the names and titles proper to Sacrifices, they are attributed to it; (and God doth not give flattering titles, nor falſe names, but ſuch as diſcover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things) it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Oblation, or offering up of himſelf, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, 1 John 2.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Rom. 3.25. to omit others; and for the nature, by vertue hereof ſin is atoned; he is our High Prieſt for this end, <hi>to make recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:119240:177"/> for the ſins of the people,</hi> Heb. 2.17. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, being by an Enallage put for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to pacifie God, reconcile God, turn away his wrath. You meet with all things in Chriſt, which concurre to the making of a Sacrifice. The Prieſt, he is our High Prieſt; the Sacrifice <hi>himſelf,</hi> Chriſt was once offered; the ſhedding of blood, and deſtroying of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being the eſſential part of a Sacrifice. Add to theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.—<hi>Chriſt our Paſſeover is Sacrificed for us;</hi> where is a double Argument; 1. That Chriſt is expreſly ſaid to be Sacrificed. 2. That he is called a Paſſeover, which at the beſt ſeems to have been both a Sacrifice and a Sacrament: Now then Chriſts death being a Sacrifice, it appeares that it appeaſed Gods wrath, procured his favour.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, From the cauſe of Chriſts death I might urge a double cauſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The inflicting cauſe it was Gods diſpleaſure: Nothing more plaine than that he had a very deep ſenſe of, and ſharp conflict with Gods wrath, from thoſe dreadful horrours in the Garden (where <hi>his ſoul was exceeding ſorrowful unto death;</hi> not certainly at the approach of an ordinary death, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Martyrs have undergone with undaunted courage; but at the apprehenſion of his Fathers anger) and upon the Croſs, where he roared out that direful complaint, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> Now then, ſeeing God being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally gracious, and perfectly righteous, cannot, will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with any without cauſe; and Chriſt had in himſelf no cauſe, <hi>There was nothing in him,</hi> Joh. 14.30. and (as you read) he <hi>alwayes did thoſe things which pleaſed him:</hi> It remains therefore that the cauſe of this diſpleaſure, and of Chrſts death, was, our ſins laid upon him, and our peace to be procured by him: And that brings in the</p>

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:119240:177"/> not being ob iged to ſtand much upon their Guard when they had no enemy in view, and having to do with enemies of a contrary make, while they avoided one extream, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Object.</hi> (Which is one of the moſt plauſible Arguments they have in this cauſe) But <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.16, 17. where Chriſt took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way diſeaſes which he did not bear, it is ſaid the ſaying of <hi>Eſaias</hi> was fulfilled therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> (To omit thoſe many Anſwers given by others, of which ſee <hi>Brinſleys</hi> one only Mediatour, and <hi>Calovius</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſcourſe <hi>De ſatisfactione Chriſti,</hi> in his <hi>Sociniſmus proſtigatus</hi>) A Scripture is ſaid to be fulfilled, either wholly, or in part: Now then you muſt know, that although it be a truth, which we conclude againſt the Papiſts, That there are no more than one of literal and co-ordinate ſenſes of every place of Scripture, yet there may be divers of ſeveral kindes, one ſubordinate to another, and one typified by another, and one accommodated to another; And when any one of theſe ſenſes are accompliſhed, that Scripture is ſaid to be fulfilled, though indeed but one piece and parcel of it be fulfilled. Thus the fulfilling of the ſame Scripture, is applied to the ſpiritual preſervation of the Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> 17.12. and to the temporal preſervation of them, <hi>John</hi> 18.9. And as it were falſe and fallacious reaſoning for any man to infer, that Chriſts keeping of his Apoſtles, cannot be underſtood ſpiritually of keeping them in his Name, and keeping them from <hi>Apostacy,</hi> as it is ſaid <hi>John</hi> 17.12. becauſe <hi>John</hi> 18.9. it is ſaid to be fulfilled in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119240:178"/> a reſcue of them from a temporal deſtruction; but rather it muſt be ſaid, it was fulfilled both wayes, and the one was ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the other, and typified in the other; So is it in this caſe: This place in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> (that it may appeare to be exactly a parallel caſe) was fulfilled two wayes; The one expreſſed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body upon the Tree.</hi> The other in this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.17. In the former is expreſſed <hi>the cauſe,</hi> Chriſts bearing the burden of our ſinnes upon his ſhoulders. In the latter, <hi>the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct,</hi> Chriſts taking off the Burden, or part of that Burden of ſin from our ſhoulders, or from the ſhoulders of thoſe diſeaſed perſons; for it was laid upon his ſhoulders, that it might be taken off from us. So that <hi>Matthew</hi> rightly tells us that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was fulfilled, and that the cauſe did appeare by the effect; as by the dawning of the day, we ſee the approach of the Sun. And this may ſerve for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying of that hard knot, which I had almoſt ſaid, is the only thing of moment the <hi>Socinians</hi> have in this Controverſie. But to return, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he was bruiſed for our iniquities; the chastiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> If it were lawful for the higheſt <hi>Antiſocinian</hi> in the world to coyne a Scripture for his purpoſe, he could not deviſe a place of a more favourable aſpect to his cauſe than this.

               </gap>xthly, And laſtly, From the peculiarity of Chriſts death. It is undeniable that Chriſt died for us, ſo as no man in the world ever did, nor can do. Therefore not in the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſenſe, not barely for the confirmation of our faith, or excitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our obedience, or ſtrengthning of our hope, or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of us in our ſufferings; for in this ſenſe, thouſands have died for you. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Co</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this for the firſt Head of Arguments, where I ſee I muſt take up, though I thought to have urged divers other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Nature of mans juſtification and ſalvation. But I will not be too tedious. What hath been ſaid may be enough to convince any indifferent man; and others will not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, though they are convinced.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the ſecond particular, the aſſertion of this truth. The third ſhould have been the vindication of it from the cavils of <hi>Socinians;</hi> but I am cut off, and it is not wholly neceſſary; for if once a truth be evident from plain Scriptures, we ought not to be moved with the cavils of wanton wits, or the difficulty of comprehending thoſe great myſteries by our reaſon; when the <hi>Socinians</hi> can ſolve all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of nature, (which are the proper Object of mans Reaſon) then, and not till then, we will hearken to their rational Objections. And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> ſomewhere lays down this Concluſion, That when once man is well ſetled in any truth, he ought not to be moved from it by ſome ſubtle Objection, which he cannot well anſwer. All this I ſpeak, not as that there were any <hi>inſolubilia,</hi> any inſuperable Objections againſt this truth that I ever met with; for though there are many things here which are <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> yet nothing which <hi>cannot be anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As when they tell you he did not ſuffer eternal death which was due to us. It is true, he did not; but a moment of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings was equal in worth to our eternal ſufferings, the dignity of the perſon being always conſiderable in the eſtimation of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the ſuffering.</p>
            <p>So when they ſay one man cannot dye for another, it is falſe; you heard <hi>David</hi> wiſh he had dyed for <hi>Abſalom;</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> threatens thoſe who ſhould let any of them eſcape, <hi>That his life ſhall go for his life,</hi> 2 Kings 10.24. and Hiſtories tell us of one man dying for another.</p>
            <p>So when they ſay it is unrighteous that God ſhould puniſh the juſt for the unjuſt.</p>

            <p>The fourth and laſt Head was by way of Application.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo, <hi>That the death of Jeſus Christ is the procuring cauſe of our Juſtification and Salvation?</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was written in their hearts, <hi>that they which do ſuch things are worthy of death;</hi> — They ſaw the need of atoning God, reconciling God; they ſaw the inſufficiency of all their Rites and Sacrifices.</p>

            <p>For good! Yes, but it is unto thoſe that be good. Hands off wicked and profane wretches; you have no part nor lot in theſe heavenly conſolations. Away baſe Swine, to your ſties, to your muck and mire, theſe pearls are not for you. Out ye Dogs, to the garbidge that lieth upon the Dunghill, the childrens bread is not for you. <hi>We know that all things ſhall work together for good unto thoſe that love God:</hi> why ſo? <hi>becauſe they are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpoſe;</hi> ſo <hi>Paraeus</hi> expoundeth the place, and with him I perfectly agree:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 14.27.</note>That which God hath purpoſed, ſhall not be fruſtrated: <hi>The Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed, and whe ſhall diſannul it? his hand is stretched out, and who ſhall turn it back?</hi> What <hi>man</hi> will ſuffer his purpoſes, thoſe purpoſes that he taketh up with beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and moſt mature deliberation, to be diſappointed if he have power to accompliſh them? the holy purpoſes of <hi>God,</hi> as they are ordered and directed by infinite Wiſdome, ſo they have infinite power to bring them to paſſe; ſo that if I can ſay God hath a purpoſe to ſave me, I may ſecurely ſmile at all the attempts of men and devils againſt me; and if I can ſay, God hath <hi>Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Called</hi> me, I may be ſure God hath choſen me, and hath a <hi>Purpoſe</hi> to ſave me; for all the links in the golden Chain of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are even wrought, not one of them wider or narrower than another; if God have <hi>Choſen,</hi> he will <hi>Call;</hi> if God <hi>Call,</hi> he hath <hi>Choſen.</hi> Once more, if I can ſay I love God, I may be ſure I am <hi>Called;</hi> for I cannot love God, except I have ſome acquaintance with him, ſome ſenſe and experience of his love towards me.

Hence the concluſion is certain, <hi>That all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God, to them that are Called according to his Purpoſe.</hi>

            <p>But I forget my ſelf; you have heard in former Diſcourſes, under what a ſad, ſoul-killing diſeaſe poor man laboureth in his natural condition; you heard likewiſe of a Soveraign remedy provided in the blood of Chriſt: I am now engaged to ſpeak to the application of that remedy in our <hi>Effectual Calling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Effectual Calling,</hi> according to Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsus ad ſalutem,</hi> our entrance into a ſtate of ſalvation; the firſt ſtep whereby God his predeſtination deſcendeth to us, and we again aſcend to the glory predeſtinated. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> I preſent from my Text may be this; <hi>There are ſome perſons in the World that are Effectually Called;</hi> or which is all one, <hi>which are Called according to the Purpoſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Call</hi> of the Goſpel that is not <hi>Effectual;</hi> of this our Saviour ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>Many are Called, but few are Choſen.</hi> How many of the poor Miniſters of the Goſpel may complain of multitudes in this generation, ſaying, with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that ſate in the Market place, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.32. <hi>We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented!</hi> Neither the delightful airs of mercy, nor the doleful dities of judgement have moved you; but the <hi>Election will certainly obtain;</hi> and the <hi>Call</hi> that is <hi>according to Gods Purpoſe,</hi> reacheth not ears only, but hearts alſo. <hi>The houre is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God,</hi> John 5.25.</p>
            <p>This work of grace is preſented to our view in a various dreſſe of words; in the Scriptures it is ſometimes a <hi>teaching,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>drawing,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>converſion,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>regeneration;</hi> and all theſe in divers reſpects, which I cannot ſtand to unfold.<note place="margin">Gratia prima.

            </p>
            <p>When it is offered to our conſideration under this notion, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>natural men ſtand at a diſtance from God;</hi> we do not uſe to call thoſe that ſtand hard by us; this was once the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Epheſians, Ye ſometimes were far of;</hi> ſometimes;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.13.</note> when? ſurely in the time of their unregeneracy; <hi>far off;</hi> from whom? from Chriſt, from the Church, from God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:119240:183"/> from themſelves; but how could they be <hi>far off from God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zanchius.</note> not in ſpaces of place; for God <hi>filleth all places with his preſence;</hi> as to his Eſſence, and providential works, <hi>he is not far from every one of us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17.27.</note> 
               <hi>for in him we live and move;</hi> but as to their hearts and affections, all natural men are far from God; <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> they do not know him, fear, love and delight in him, they do not breath after communion with him; <hi>even when they draw nigh unto him with their lips, their hearts are far from him.</hi> If it ſometimes happen that we call thoſe that are at hand, then uſually they are ſuch as are aſleep; <hi>ſin is a deep ſleep of the ſoul;</hi> and as ſleep bindeth all the ſenſes of the outward man, ſo ſin all the powers of the inward; a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of ſin can do nothing for God, neither can he enjoy any thing from God; it may be he dreams of great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions he receiveth from the worlds dainties; but <hi>when he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his ſoul is empty.</hi> Or further, if they be not aſleep, they are ſuch as mind ſomething elſe than he would have them. <hi>All natural men minde ſomething elſe than God would have them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>they minde earthly things. Herod</hi> mindeth the dancing of a lewd Strumpet, more than the preaching of the holy Baptiſt; the young man mindeth his great poſſeſſions; the Epicure his belly; the Farmer his barn; <hi>Judas</hi> his bag; the Silverſmith his Shrines; the Gadarenes their Swine; <hi>Pila e</hi> the favour and applauſe of the people. Let the beſt men ſpeak ingenuouſly, and they muſt needs confeſſe that there were many things (if I may call them things, rather nothings) which they minded more than God or Chriſt, or Heaven, more than the higheſt concernments of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls, the weightieſt buſineſſe of Eternal ſalvation; they were all <hi>Gallios</hi> in reſpect of theſe things, <hi>they cared for none of them,</hi> till they were rouzed out of their waking dreams by the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Call</hi> of the moſt gracious God. This is the condition of every natural man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It preſuppoſeth, That <hi>it is an eaſie thing with God to bring us home to himſelf;</hi> though we be never ſo far diſtant from him; to awaken us to his ſervice, though in a dead ſleep of ſin; to raiſe our minds to higher objects, though they be never ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immerſed in the things of this preſent world. Is any thing hard to the Almighty? with a word he made us, with a word he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new us: <hi>When darkneſſe covered the face of the deep, he did but
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:119240:183"/> ay Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> with the like facility can he ſhine in our hearts, giving us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus. <hi>He uttereth his voice</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and the earth melteth.</hi> Let but God utter his voice, and the Rocks and Mountains of our corruptions will melt away like wax.</p>
            <p>Come we now cloſer to the Point.</p>

                  <hi>Queſtion 1.</hi> What is this Calling?</head>
               <p>It is the real ſeparation of the ſoul unto God; and a cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with ſuch gracious abilities, whereby it may be enabled to repent of its ſinnes, and to believe in his Son. It is our Tranſlation from the ſtate of Nature which is a ſtate of ſinne, wrath, death, and damnation, to a ſtate of Grace, which is a ſtate of Holineſs, Life, Peace, and Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Tranſlation is wrought</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By ſtrong convictions of the minde.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, Of the guilt and filth <hi>of ſin,</hi> of the danger and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, of the malignity of ſin, and the miſery that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it. Once ſaith the ſoul (that is under this diſpenſation of Gods Grace) Once I lookt upon ſin as my wiſdome; now it is madneſs and folly: Once I accounted it my meat and drink to <hi>fulfill the wills of the fleſh;</hi> ſinne was a ſweet morſel,<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Of the vanity and emptineſs of the creature,</hi> which we have Idolized, confiding in it as the ſtaff of our hopes, breathing and purſuing after it as the perfection of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Of the abſolute need of Christ,</hi> that if he do not ſave vs, we muſt periſh.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Of the abſolute fulneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>in him</hi> we may be <hi>compleat;</hi> if we be guilty, he can juſtifie us; if we be filthy, he can purge us; if we be weak, he can ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us; if we be poor, he can enrich us; if we be baſe, he can ennoble us; if we be deformed and ugly, he can make us beautiful and lovely; if we be miſerable, he can bleſs us, and that with all Bleſſings in Heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Of the clemency, goodneſs, meekneſs, ſweetneſs, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of his diſpoſition, that if any man come to him, he will in no wiſe reject him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 6.37.</note> Theſe things the minde is ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc't of, yet if there be not a farther work, a man may carry theſe Convictions to Hell with him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, this Tranſlation is wrought <hi>by a powerful inclination, and converſion of the will</hi> to cloſe with Chriſt upon his own termes, to embrace him as Soveraign as well as Saviour; to take him as men uſe to do their Wives, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer; to ſtick to him on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> as well as Mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> to welcome him into thy boſome, by bidding an everlaſting farewell to thy ſinnes. In a word, to make a voluntary tender, and reſignation of thy ſelf unto him, ſolemnly avouching, that from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thou wilt count thy ſelf more his, than thou art thine own; and the more thy own, becauſe thou art his.</p>
               <p>This work is carried on with a moſt efficacious ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo that the liberry of the will is not infringed, whilſt
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119240:184"/> the obſtinacy of the will is maſtered and over-ruled.</p>
               <p>If you ask me, How can theſe things be? I never ſtudied to ſatisfie curioſity; but if you can tell me <hi>how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child,</hi> I alſo will tell you how the parts of the new man are formed in the heart; but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſilence and humble admiration will be beſt on both ſides; if there be ſo great a myſtery in our natural generation, ſurely there is a far greater in our ſpiritual Regeneration; if <hi>David</hi> could ſay of the former, <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made;</hi> much more might he ſay of the latter, <hi>I am fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully renewed.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. As God may juſtly challenge this work to himſelf, ſo it is altogether impoſſible it ſhould be accompliſhed by any other. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. This effectual vocation, is a <hi>spiritual reſurrection</hi> of the ſoul; while we are in a ſtate of Nature, we are dead; not ſick or languiſhing, not ſlumbring or ſleeping, but quite <hi>dead in trespaſses and ſinnes;</hi> when we are call'd into a ſtate of grace, then are our ſoules raiſed to walk with God here, as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at the laſt day ſhall be raiſed to walk with the Sonne of God unto all eternity. Now if it be not in the power of any creature to raiſe the body from the grave of death (upon which account it is uſed as an Argument of the Divinity of Chriſt, that he raiſed himſelf) much leſs is it in the power of any creature to raiſe the ſoul from the grave of ſinne. And therefore do all true Believers experiment the power of God,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.19, 20.</note> even that <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greatneſs of power;</hi> that Might of his Power, as the Greek hath it, <hi>whereby he raiſed up Christ from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This effectual vocation, is <hi>a new Creation</hi> of the ſoul, whence we are ſaid to be <hi>Created in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> when we are called unto an experimental knowledge of him, and unfeigned Faith in him; upon which account it muſt needs be <hi>Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip;</hi> for power of creating, is not, cannot be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any creature. Though the Angels <hi>excell in ſtrength,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.20.</note> and wonderful things have been performed by them, when they have as <hi>Miniſters</hi> executed Gods pleaſure in the puniſhment of the wicked, and protection of the righteous; yet the mighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Angel cannot create the meaneſt worm that is; the only product of infinite power. And let me tell you, if infinite power be manifeſted in the Creation of the world, it is more gloriouſly manifeſted in the converſion of a ſinner. There is a worſe Chaos, a worſe confuſion upon the heart of man, when God undertaketh his <hi>new Creation,</hi> than there was upon the face of the earth in the <hi>Old Creation:</hi> In the earth, when it was <hi>without forme, and void,</hi> there was only indiſpoſition;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.2.</note> but

               <p>Well then, I peremptorily conclude that the work is Gods; Gods by the way of <hi>a principal efficiency,</hi> and not only by way of <hi>motion or perſwaſion,</hi> as ſome would have it, wherein I fear a piece of curſed brokeage for their own glory.</p>
               <p>For were it ſo, they would be but very mean acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that do belong to God, for the change of a moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unhappy eſtate. Suppoſe I ſhould go to ſome wealthy Citizen, and preſent him an object of charity, uſing the moſt cogent Conſiderations which my Art and Wit could invent, to inforce a liberal Contribution; thereupon he freely parts with his mony for the relief of that indigent perſon; tell me now to which of us is he mainly engaged to return thanks? to me the <hi>mover,</hi> or to him the <hi>beſtower?</hi> I make no queſtion but your Judicious thoughts have made an award of the chief acknowledgement to the Latter.

Finally, Other bleſſings and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits can never make us happy, but as they finde us miſerable, ſo they leave us; we may, and are too apt to bleſs our ſelves in them, yet God never intended to bleſs us in the ſole enjoyment of them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Chryſ. Theod. Theoph.</note> but according to <hi>our own purpoſe;</hi> to hear and obey his call.

God doth not alwayes take the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, but the moſt knotty pieces of Timber, to make pillars in his houſe. He goes not alwayes to places of ſevereſt and ſtricteſt Diſcipline, to pick out ſome few there to plant in his Houſe; but he goes to the Cuſtome-Houſe, and calls one thence; to the Brothel-Houſe, and calls another thence: And if yet you inſiſt upon the purpoſe of man, as an inducement to the call of God, pray tell me what was <hi>Sauls</hi> purpoſe, when God met with him in the way to <hi>Damaſcus?</hi> Had he any other purpoſe than

               <p>Alwayes this work is carried on by weak means; Thus I have heard it credibly reported, that a ſentence written in a window, and accidentally read by an inveterate ſinner, pierc't his heart, and let out the corruption thence; the ſentence was that of <hi>Austin, He that hath promiſed pardon to the penitent, hath not promiſed repentance to the preſumptuous ſinner.</hi> Thus <hi>Austin</hi> was converted with a <hi>Tolle, lege, Take up the book and read;</hi> the Book was the New Teſtament; the place he opened was

               <p>Beloved in the LORD, I have anſwered you many Queſtions; I beſeech you anſwer me a few. Me, ſaid I? Nay, anſwer them to God and your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Are you of the number of the Called?</hi> Called by the Goſpel I know you are; but that may be your miſery.

Doth the prcie of heavenly Commodities riſe in your hearts, and the price of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trumpery fall? Do you love God, and his Sonne Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in ſincerity? Then I can aſſure you, not in the word of a mortal man, which is as good as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but in the Word of God that cannot lye, even in the words of my Text, <hi>You are Called according to his purpoſe.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) it aboliſheth the convincing power of ſin, or its guilt. Our buſineſſe therefore is to diſcover the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe at Gods bar, in the juſtification of a ſinner, which will be beſt done by comparing it with that at mans, which we are familiarly acquainted with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be juſtified,</hi> therefore implies in general three things. 1. The perſon is charg'd with guilt. 2. Pleads to the charge. 3. Upon that plea is diſcharged by the Judge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A juſtified perſon muſt be <hi>charg'd with guilt.</hi> Now guilt is the Relation which ſin hath to puniſhment; for ſin is the breach of the Law, and puniſhment is the vengeance which the Law threatens for that breach. And as the threatening it ſelf is in the nature of it a guard to the Law, to prevent the breach of it, bidding as it were the tranſgreſſour come at his peril, break the Law if he dare, be wiſe before hand, leſt he rue it too late; ſo the puniſhment in the very nature of it, is a vindication of the equity of the injur'd Law, the reparation and amends it makes it ſelf for the wrong done it, by damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the perſon, injuring her proportionally to the injury: Now that a juſtified perſon muſt be charged with guilt, <hi>i. e.</hi> with the breach of Law; and by conſequence with deſert of puniſhment, appears, becauſe otherwiſe if a man be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced tighteous, whom no body ever accuſed or queſtioned, he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praiſed, not juſtified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The perſon to be juſtified, muſt <hi>plead for himſelf;</hi> either in perſon, or by his Advocate who ſuſtains his perſon; for to refuſe to plead, is to deſpaire quite of being juſtified; and to abandon ones ſelf over unto puniſhment, <hi>ſilence gives conſent;</hi> it argues the accuſed perſon hath nothing to ſay for himſelf, why he ſhould not be condemned. Our Law, you know, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no mercy to one that will not plead, he is to be Preſt to death.</p>
            <p>An endited perſon muſt plead therefore ſomething in his own behalf, why he ſhould be juſtified, if he would be. Now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the man is guilty of the charge, or not guilty. I muſt ſpeak to both caſes, and ſhew what pleas are requiſite in each,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:119240:208"/> and which of them is the plea upon which a ſinner is juſtified at the Bar of God.</p>

If the endited perſon be <hi>not guilty</hi> of the charge, juſtice it ſelf muſt juſtifie him upon that plea. <hi>Si accuſaſſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiat, quis erit innocens?</hi> an innocent perſon may be accuſed, he can never be convinc't; for that that is not, can never be demonſtrated; the Judge or Jury were themſelves guilty, if they found innocence guilty. Now to be juſtified thus, is to be purely and meerly juſtified, not at all to be pardoned; for ſuch a one ſtands upon his termes, bears himſelf upon his own righteouſneſſe, begs no mercy. 'Tis no favour to juſtifie him, 'tis his due; he is not beholding to the Judge a jot, the exact rigour of the Law acquits him.</p>
            <p>To bring this to the preſent buſineſſe, I ſhall demonſtrate that we can never be juſtified at the Bar of God, by pleading <hi>not guilty;</hi> For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the plea is falſe. Although in a very reſtrained ſenſe, there is none ſo wicked but he may plead not guilty, and be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified as to this or that particular fact charged upon him. <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> was not guilty of <hi>Abels</hi> murther. Nay, a Saint may be guilty of ſome ſins which the Devil may plead not guilty too, as grieving the comforting, the ſealing Spirit, abuſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers grace, &amp;c. yet nothing ſhort of univerſal innocence, nothing but a perfect righteouſneſſe, a total exemption from all manner of guilt will entitle us before Gods Tribunal to this plea;<note place="margin">James 2.10.</note> 
               <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.</hi>

               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:119240:208"/>3. Becauſe thereby he becomes infected with a contagious diſpoſition to be guilty of all; the ſame principle which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden'd him now, will another time (if but excited with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſtrengths of temptation) to commit any other ſin, or to repeat the ſame ſins again and again, (though excited with ſtill weaker and weaker temptations) for as frequent acts ſtrengthen the habit of ſin, ſo the habit facilitates the acts.</p>
            <p>From hence it appeares, that the holy Angels, that <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, that the man Chriſt Jeſus might indeed plead <hi>not guilty</hi> before God, and be juſtified upon that plea; but now impoſſible for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20.23. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 14.1. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the plea being falſe, there is no hope upon this iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to be juſtified, unleſſe there were ſome defect in the Judge, or in the evidence. In the Judge either of prudence, in not underſtanding; or of integrity or power, in not executing the Law aright: But in our caſe theſe are alike, that is, infinitely impoſſible; for we have to do with the All-wiſe Legiſlator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is alſo the Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty, and <hi>ſhall not this Judge of all the earth do right?</hi>

               <hi>and the dead ſhall be judged out of thoſe things which are written in the books, according to their works.</hi> Nay, even now there are two day-books a filling, down goes (every houre, every moment) all we do and think, and ſpeak, in the book of Gods remembrance fairly written; not an iota, not a tittle either miſt or blurred; of this God hath given us a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart to keep in our own boſomes, the Regiſter of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (though a very imperfect copy, full of blots, miſtakes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, yet) enough alone to convince us inſtead of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes; for every ſinner will be his own accuſer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner, riſing up as an Advocate in the behalf of the great Judge, againſt himſelf at the day of judgement.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Caſe</hi> 2. And this was the firſt plea, <hi>not guilty;</hi> but the caſe is not ours, and therefore this plea will never juſtifie us. I come therefore to the other (which in our caſe) <hi>is guilty;</hi> and here
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:119240:209"/> are two wayes of pleading. Firſt, <hi>meer mercy, for mercies</hi> ſake; but indeed this is not to plead at all, but to beg. And as in the laſt caſe, when an innocent perſon upon his pleading not guilty is diſcharg'd, that is pure juſtification, but no pardon: ſo here quite contrary; when a guilty perſon is diſcharg'd out of mercy, this is pure pardon, but no juſtification; for there ſhines not one beame of Juſtice in ſuch a diſcharge, meer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is all in all. Whence it follows, that the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who to avoid the neceſſity of acknowledging Chriſts ſatisfaction to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, affirm that <hi>Juſtification</hi> is nothing but meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, do abuſe <hi>the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d,</hi> and contradict themſelves; for who ſeeth not that to be pardon'd <hi>gratis,</hi> out of pure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (without the leaſt reparation made either for the injury and indignity done to the Law, or ſatisfaction to the honour, juſtice and authority of the Law-giver, by the ſin affronted) is not <hi>to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> justified</hi> at all, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but only <hi>to be gratified,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; i. e. diſcharged upon the ſole account of mercy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration had of juſtice. This is the firſt way of pleading when <hi>guilty,</hi> meer mercy for mercies ſake; but to be <hi>juſtified</hi> upon this plea, is an evident contradiction. Therefore ſecondly, the only plea for a guilty perſon to be juſtified upon, is to plead mercy for the ſake of ſome ſatisfaction made to the juſtice and honour of the Law. And by how much the fuller this ſatisfaction is, by ſo much the fuller is the juſtification of ſuch a perſon as is upon this plea diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Now a full ſatisfaction may be made two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſuffering the whole penalty due.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When a valuable conſideration is accepted by the offended party or Judge, wherein the honour of the Law is as much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as if it had never been broken; or as if being broken, the full penalty had been inflicted on the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I have theſe two things to prove. 1. That man could never make ſuch ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God, nor any creature for him. 2. That the Lord Chriſt hath made ſuch full ſatisfaction, that it ſtands now with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the holy God, to juſtifie ſinners upon the termes of the Goſpel.</p>
            <pb n="407" facs="tcp:119240:209"/>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Aſſertion. </seg>1</label> Firſt, That neither man, nor any creature could ſatisfie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended juſtice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not by ſuffering the penalty; for that being infinite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an infinite continuance under it (there bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g no other way for an finite creature to ſuffer infinitely) and ſo the whole penalty will ever be ſuffering, but can never be ſuffered; for in etetnity, ſtop where you will, and there is yet as much to come, as is already paſt; nay, infinitely more, for that which is paſt, is but a finite time of ſuffering; though millions of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are paſt, but an eternity of ſuffering is yet to come; and after as many more millions of ages, ſtill, ſtill an infinite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is future, that never can be ſo exhauſted, but an eternity will ſtill be left.</p>
            <p>Secondly, not by any act of ſervice, which amounts to a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſideration worthy to be accepted of the Judge as ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to his affronted juſtice, for two Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe God is more diſhonoured by one ſin, than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by an eternity of obedience; for God is not at all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Cherubims and Seraphims for obeying him; all the Creation naturally oweth its utmoſt poſſibility of ſervice, as an eternal debt to its great Creatour. Now the leaſt act of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or ſin, being injury and Treaſon, thereby a new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is contracted, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuffer condigne puniſhment, the former obligation unto duty remaining eternally in as full force as ever; <hi>which if we could diſcharge, yet were we but unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervants,</hi> Luke 17.10. <hi>Can a man be profitable to God?</hi> Job 22.2. <hi>If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou to him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</hi> Job 35.7. An eternity of ſervice in the higheſt perfection, is every creatures debt as a creature; and beſides this, an eternity of ſuffering too, is every delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent creatures debt, as delinquent. But one debt cannot pay another; ſince therefore all that the whole Creation can do for ever, would but juſt ſatisfie the firſt natural obligation unto <hi>pure juſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> viz. the debt of obedience; it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te impoſſible that ever any creature ſhould ſupererogate, or ſpare any thing from hence, towards ſatisfying the ſecondary ſuperadded ob igation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>offend d iuſtice,</hi> viz. the debt of puniſhment, either in its own behalf or anothers.</p>
            <pb n="408" facs="tcp:119240:210"/>
            <p>Secondly, The other reaſon why neither man, nor any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for him, can ever ſatisfie the offended Creator by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſervices, becauſe they all have it from him when they do obey him; of his own do they give him; for in him we live, and move, and have our being; What haſt thou, O man, nay, O Angel, O Arch-angel, that thou haſt not received? all our, nay, all their ſprings are in him; without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The more we do for God, the more he doth for us; and conſequently, ſtill the more we owe him. So that acts of obedience are ſo farre from ſatisfying our Obligations to God, as that they contract new ones, for even for them are we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Aſſertion. </seg>2</label> Having cleared the firſt, we come to the ſecond point, That Chriſt hath ſo fully ſatisfied his Fathers offended juſtice, as it ſtands now with the honour of the holy God to juſtifie every ſinner, that can upon Goſpel termes, plead his intereſt in this ſatisfaction. Here we muſt enquire into theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The matter of this ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The forme, or that which makes it infinitely ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and meritorious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What are thoſe Goſpel terms.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the matter of Chriſts ſatisfaction, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the whole ſtate of his humiliation, from his conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to his reſurrection (for at his reſurrection began the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtate of Chriſt as Mediatior; <hi>viz.</hi> his exaltation, to be continued to the general Reſurrection, and then he ſhall reſign up the Kingdome to the Father, and God ſhall be thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28.) that this ſtate (I ſay) of our Redeemers humiliation, is entirely lookt upon by God as the valuable conſideration, wherein his juſtice with honour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſceth, and reſts ſatisfied. It hath two parts. Firſt, his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the forme of a ſervant at his incarnation. Secondly, his management of, and deportment in that ſtate.</p>
            <p>Firſt, his Incarnation, and this preſents God with a double ſatisfaction, whereby he may with honour entertain thoughts of love to man-kind.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that humane nature is in Chriſt unſtained with either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal or actual ſin; for by his divine conception by the holy
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:119240:210"/> Ghoſt, he received of his Virgin-mother, a pure, undeflowred, Virgin humane nature; the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> revives the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the firſt; thoſe eyes could without diſparagement behold his manhood, which are purer than to behold iniquity; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their ſight, though no other fleſh living could, yet this fleſh muſt be juſtified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that humane nature is in him dignified with union to the divine, and is become the ſeat and manſion of the Godhead; ſo that how loathſome ſoever ſin hath rendred it in us, yet in him it is highly exalted; even as highly, as the Divine Nature in him was abaſed; for the Humane Nature aſcends juſt in the ſame proportion, as the Divine deſcended, that is, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt poſſibility; for God could ſtoop no lower than to become a man, nor man riſe higher than to be perſonally one with God.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee Chriſts entering into his ſtate of Humiliation, hath rendred the nature of man very conſiderable againe in the ſight of God; ſo that he can now with honour, exerciſe good will towards it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His management of this ſtate, conſiſts in his active and paſſive righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>By his active Righteouſneſſe, I mean his obedience to the whole Law; to the Ceremonial, in being circumciſed, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, keeping the three yearly feaſts, &amp;c. To the moral, in not committing one ſin, or neglecting one commanded duty, even to ſubjection to his Parents, and paying Tribute to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his paſſive Righteouſneſſe, I mean all that he ſuffered in his life-time, as the meanneſſe of his birth and education; his perſecution by <hi>Herod</hi> in his infancy, after by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> his hunger and temptation in the Wilderneſſe, his poverty and ſtraits, he had not where to lay his head; in a word, <hi>he was all his life long in all things tempted as we are (yet without ſin)</hi> Heb. 4.15. but eſpecially what he ſuffered at his death.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in his body, he was ſcourg'd, ſpit upon, crown'd with Thornes, and latength crucified; which was, 1. A cruel death; the Latine <hi>cruciari,</hi> to be tormented, is derived <hi>à cruce,</hi> from being crucified. 2. A reproachful one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.13.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:119240:211"/> it was the Roman death for ſlaves and Malefactors.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, moſt of all he ſuffered in his ſoule, witneſſe thoſe expreſſions, <gap reason="foreign">

But if we conſider (which they deny) that Chriſt was then ſatisfying his Fathers Juſtice, we need not wonder at thoſe horrours and conſternations of the manhood; for he knew the vaſtneſſe of his undertaking, the numberleſſe numbers, and aggravations of ſins, the dreadful weight of his Fathers wrath, the ſharpneſſe of that ſword, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7. which he was going now to feele (not that God was angry with Chriſt upon the Croſſe, <hi>quoad affectum;</hi> no, he never more dearly loved him; but <hi>quoad effectum</hi>) adde Chriſts infinite abhorrence of the ſins he bore, and that infinite zeal wherewith he was inflam'd to vindicate the honour of Divine juſtice. Now his infinite love to his Church ſtruggling with all theſe, produc't thoſe agonies, and overcame them all, when he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed, Joh.</hi> 19.30. we meet him next triumphing in his Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>But here to reſolve that great queſtion, whether Chriſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Righteouſneſſe alone, or active and paſſive joyntly, are the matter of Chriſts ſatisfaction, which believers plead at Gods Bar for their Juſtification, and which being accepted by God as a plea good in Law, is ſaid to be imputed (<hi>viz.</hi> in a Law-ſenſe) for Righteouſneſſe. Let theſe Reaſons be weighed by ſuch as do disjoyne them.</p>
            <pb n="411" facs="tcp:119240:211"/>
            <p>Firſt, each of them hath its proper intereſt in, and its reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive contribution towards the ſatisfying the injur'd honour of Gods Law. For the honour of Gods Law, is the equity of both its parts, its command, and its threatening; Chriſts active Righteouſneſſe honours the equity of the firſt, which man had diſhonoured by his diſobedience; but the great God-man hath repaired the honour of Gods Commandments, by yielding a moſt perfect obedience to every one of them, and therein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>the Law to be holy, juſt and good.</hi> Then Chriſts paſſive Righteouſneſſe in like manner honours the equity of the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening; for as by <hi>obeying,</hi> he acknowledged Gods authority to make a Law, and his unexceptionable righteouſneſſe in every ſingle Branch of the Law made; ſo by <hi>ſuffering,</hi> he proclaimeth that man is bound to keep it; or if he <hi>do</hi> not, <hi>to</hi> beare the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. He himſelf dyes to juſtifie that the ſinner is worthy of death, and offers himſelf upon the Croſſe as a Sacrifice to the Divine Juſtice; and hereby he hath proclaimed ſin to be exceeding ſinful, and God to be ſo jealous a God, as rather than ſin ſhould go unpuniſh'd, and his juſtice want its glory, the righteous, eternal Son of God muſt be made an example, what guilty man had deſerved. Thus God by two equal mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (of everlaſting aſtoniſhment to be adored) hath ſatisfied both his contending Attributes, and rendred each of them Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, in making his righteous Son an example of his ſin-avenging juſtice, that guilty ſinners (repenting and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) might be made examples of his ſin-pardoning-goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, as each hath its reſpective intereſt in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the injur'd Law, ſo neither of them can be anywhere ſevered from the other; and thoſe which God hath ſo indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubly joyned, let none part aſunder; for Chriſts active Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe was everywhere paſſive, becauſe all of it done in the forme of a ſervant; for in our nature he obeyed the Law, but in his very incarnation he was paſſive, for therein he ſuffered an ecclipſe of the glory of his Godhead. And his paſſive Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe was everywhere active; becauſe what he ſuffered was not by conſtraint, or againſt his Will; no, it was his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act and deed all along; let me inſtance in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of his ſufferings; his very dying was the product both

            <p>In the third place, both Chriſts active and paſſive Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, what he did, and what he ſuffered, partake in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the <hi>forme of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now for the work of a ſervant to be done by the Lord of all, renders his active; and for him to ſuffer as a Malefactor between Malefactors, who was God bleſſed for evermore, renders alſo his paſſive righteouſneſſe infinitely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious; no wonder the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin, for it is the blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. And this is the Reaſon why the Righteouſneſſe of one, redounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all for <hi>the juſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5.18, 19. becauſe his active and paſſive Righteouſneſſe is infinitely of more value, than all, that all the creatures in heaven and earth could have done or ſuffered to eternity; the very man Chriſt Jeſus, is above all the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. for he is the man that is Gods fellow, <hi>Zechary</hi> 13.7. And this infinite worthineſſe of the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers perſon, you have excellently deſcribed, as irradiating and infinitely exalting all he did and ſuffered, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24, 25, 28.</p>

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:119240:212"/> childe Jeſus defile his mothers womb, as common mortals do that are conceiv'd in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity? And yet he was circumciſed and baptized, and his mother offered for her purification, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>ch.</hi> 3.21. No imaginable obligation lay on him to theſe ſubmiſſions, being to him meer ciphers wholly inſignificant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His obedience to the Moral Law; Although it muſt be granted that as man it was his duty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. yet was it not his duty to become man. True, a creatures homage was due from him, when a creature; a ſervants work, when in the form of a ſervant; but the whole was free and arbitrary, becauſe his entring into that ſtate was ſo; for what but his own infinite love could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver move the eternal Word to pitch his Tent in our Nature? what obligation lay on the Heir of all things to take the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? who bound the eternal Son of God to become in the fulneſſe of time the Son of man?</p>
            <p>And as his active righteouſneſſe, ſo ſecondly, his paſſive too was a meer ſupererogation; for his Almighty Fathers Holy, All-ſeeing Eye could never eſpy the leaſt iniquity in him to puniſh; what had the Divine Juſtice to do with him? for he was a ſinleſſe perſon, he ſuffered not for himſelf, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. No, for us; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. And therefore ſince no obligation lay on him to do what he did, or to ſuffer what he ſuffered, he may impute the merit both of the one, and the other, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and upon what termes ſoever he and his Father pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But before I come to conſider the termes upon which Chriſts ſatisfaction is applied, I muſt anſwer ſome queſtions, and clear the ſcruples in the way.</p>

What is become of the Law of that firſt Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe? <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. repeated again to the Jews, <hi>Deut:</hi> 27.26. The ſum of which you have fully expreſſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: It is not executed nor abrogated, but releaſed, or diſpenſed with.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is not fully executed; for there is no condemnation to them that re in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s not abrogated; for it is in part executed upon Believers; they are liable to the <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>natural</hi> death, <hi>which is
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:119240:213"/> the wages of ſin,</hi> although <hi>the ſecond death hath no power over them;</hi> beſides all manner of chaſtiſements and afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32. And alſo that Law is totally executed upon finally impenitent unbelievers, over whom not the firſt only, but the ſecond death alſo hath power, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>For he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not is condemned already,</hi> John 3.18. That is, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel finds him, and every one in a ſtate of condemnation; but thoſe who believe, it proclaims deliverance to; thoſe who through unbelief reject it, (judging themſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46.) it leaves ſuch as it found them; <hi>viz.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condemnation of the Old Covenant, ſince they refuſe the pardoning mercy of the New.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer therefore poſitively, that the firſt Covenant is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, and diſpenſed with, by ſuper-inducing a New Covenant of Grace over it, that whoſoever cloſeth with, and comes into the terms of the New, ſhould be exempted from the rigour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; <hi>i. e.</hi> from the eternal condemnation of the Old, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. It is not ſaid, He that believes ſhall not be ſick, ſhall not be afflicted, ſhall not dye; No, <hi>but he ſhall not periſh.</hi> Thus you ſee the Covenant of Works as to its execution upon ſuch as are in the Covenant of Grace, is in the chief part reſtrained; but yet in ſome part inflicted: They never ſhall complain under the <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>destructive;</hi> yet they do complain under the <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>corrective</hi> puniſhment of their ſinnes, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39.</p>
            <p>Yet more particularly for the clearer underſtanding of this, we muſt conſider that the firſt Covenant lays a double obligation on ſinful man.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In reference to what is paſt; and here it requires ſatisfaction and reparation from us for our ſin in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, In reference to the future; after ſuch ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and amends made, it requires perfect conformity ſtill as at firſt, abſolute obedience to all Gods commands being the eternal debt of the reaſonable creature to that God that made it in his own Image; if therefore we could (which hath already been proved to be impoſſible) ever have ſatisfied Gods injur'd Law for our paſt breach, the Law would ſtill have come upon us for future, exact conformity to pay the reſidue of that eternal debt; and its lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:119240:213"/> would be, <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing befall thee;</hi> as a <hi>Felon,</hi> though butn't in the hand, is yet bound to live honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the future at his peril. Now the New Covenant of Grace relieves us as to both theſe caſes, and diſpences with the rigor of the Law.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, It comforts us with the good news, that the Son of God hath ſatisfied his Fathers Juſtice; and if we believe but in him, God will accept of us, as if we had ſatisfied in our own perſons. The caſe the Law leaves us in, is well expreſſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>&amp; Hebr.</hi> 10.31. But the relief the Goſpel brings us in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> language, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. You have both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellently, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10, 11.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond Obligation, the New Covenant diſpenſeth with the rigor of that too; for woe to a juſtified and pardoned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if he muſt loſe all again, upon the leaſt defailance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel proclaims pardon of ſin upon repentance, and acceptance of ſincere endeavours to obey him. Gods language now is, Sinners be but in good earneſt, do but love me heartily, and my ways; let me but ſee a childe-like ingenuity in you, and I will put down your upright, though imperfect performances, in the book of my remembrance, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. and blot out your tranſgreſſions when repented of, out of the book of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. <hi>Mandata Dei tanquam facta reputantur,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>quando quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid non fit ignoſcitur.</hi> Thus doth the candor of the Goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the rigor of the Law; God deals not with us as an Aegyptian task-maſter, but as a Father with his children whom he loves: <hi>Chriſts yoke is eaſie, his burden light.</hi>
            </p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> If any doubt how it ſtands with Gods veracity and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, having once declared that the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall dye, to contradict it by declaring that, <hi>He that believeth ſhall never dye,</hi> but have eternal life.<note place="margin">John 11.26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: We muſt look upon threatnings as a part of the Law, declaring the dueneſſe of the puniſhment, what the offender hath deſerved to ſuffer; not as predictions of the event, any more than Thou ſhalt, and Thou ſhalt not in the command, are predictions: but only are expreſſive of the dueneſſe of obedience. Nor will it hence follow, that we have the leaſt cauſe once to ſuſpect that God may (if he pleaſe) revoke his promiſes, as well as his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; and then what would become of us? for there is a wide
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:119240:214"/> difference in their eſſential natures and properties. In a promiſe, the obligation lies upon the party promiſing; he hath paſt away his own liberty, and the thing is now no longer his, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who may if he pleaſe, releaſe and quit-claim to his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he may diſpenſe with, and ſurrender his own right; but if he claime his right to, and intereſt in the benefit, by vertue of the promiſe, it cannot be detained without notorious wrong and injury, which God forbid we ſhould charge him with; for he were not God, if he were not infinitely true and faithful. <hi>How ſhould he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lſe judge the world?</hi> But now the Obligation unto puniſhment lies contrarily upon the ſinner threatned; he hath paſt away his own indemnity, and given God the right of puniſhing him: I ſay the right, not the neceſſity; if God will claime this right, he may; but if he pleaſe, he may diſpence with it. It is no injury if he puniſheth; yet no Obligation lies upon him but his own honour: And that indeed obligeth him not, never to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with his Law; but never to diſpenſe with it upon a light cauſe, or upon termes misbecoming his Glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. And the diſpenſation we now ſpeak of is an honourable one; for</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are weighty inducements moving God hereunto. If he had not diſpenc't with the rigor of it,</p>
            <p>Firſt, He had loſt the opportunity of the higheſt poſſible way of glorifying his own goodneſſe, which now ſo infinitely endears him to the world, and lays ſuch Obligations on us to admire and adore him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As all <hi>Iſrael</hi> lamented over <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Judg. 21.6. that a Tribe was loſt; ſo the Creation would have miſt a Tribe; which is the reaſon ſome Divines have given why Chriſt <hi>took not on him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only ſome of the Angelical Tribe loſt their birth-right; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome <hi>kept not their firſt eſtate;</hi> but <hi>man being in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour continued not, but became like the Beaſt that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, All Religion had been extinguiſh't, and frozen by deſpair unavoidably; if there had been no hope, the fear of God, his worſhip and ſervice had for ever utterly periſh't from off the earth. But now <hi>his Name is excellent in all the earth;</hi> even that Name Proclaimed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 34.6.
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:119240:214"/> The Lord is known in <hi>Judah,</hi> and his Name is great in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 79.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the cauſes inducing are weighty, ſo the terms on which he diſpenſeth with his Law are as honourable; which was our third <hi>Query</hi> propounded in the opening the point. For ſince Chriſt Redeemed us, not by way of Solution (ſtrictly) as a Surety, paying the Debtors proper debt to the Creditor; but by way of Satisfaction, as a Mediator and Interceſſor, offering a valuable conſideration to the offended Judge of the world, in lieu of the Laws executing the penalty threatned upon the ſin er: It neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows that no right at all in the benefits of this ſatisfaction can accrue to the Delinquent, but upon ſuch terms preciſely as the offended party, and the Mediator that ſatisfieth him, ſhall agree unto; and upon mutual treaty and compromiſe, joyntly ratifie; ſo that juſtification by way of ſatisfaction provides no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> only for the ſinners indemnity, but in ſuch a manner, as alſo to conſult the intereſts and honour both of the party ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isfying, and ſatisfied; and this latter is the rule and meaſure of exhibiting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and of making over the ſatisfaction for diſcharge of the offender.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Query. </seg>3</label> What are the terms therefore upon which both God and Chriſt have agreed to juſtifie ſinners?</p>
            <p>I anſwer: firſt, faith, which is a hearty receiving Chriſt as he is tendred by the Goſpel, and here the ſoul quits all pretenſions of being juſtified by any righteouſneſſe of its own, and rolls it ſelf upon the Lord its righteouſneſſe; and therefore hath faith the honour to be the juſtifying grace, becauſe it ſo highly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Chriſt; it is the nuptial knot whereby the ſoul joyns it ſelf to its Lord-Redeemer in an everlaſting Marriage-Covenant; it denies its ſelf, and forſakes all its other Lovers, and claſps about its Lord and Husband, as its all in all. Look what a wife doth in a Marriage-Covenant to her husband, that doth a ſoul in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto Chriſt, it ſaith unto him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> thou art my husband, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.16. And he ſaith unto his Spouſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> you are my people.</p>
            <p>But then this juſtifying faith hath two daughters that inſeparably attend her.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Repentance: Here ſinful man retracts and undoes his faults, cryes <hi>peccavi,</hi> weeps, wrings his hands, ſmites upon his breaſt,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:119240:215"/> and cryes What have I done? Laments after the Lord, and abhors himſelf in duſt and aſhes: He calls himſelf fool, mad man, beaſt, traytor to his God, and to his ſoul: In a word, executes the Law upon himſelf; and ſince God excuſeth him from the puniſhment, he accuſeth himſelf of the guilt, and condemns himſelf to the ſhame of his ſin; and hereby the ſinner honours the equity of the threatning, by his tears acknowledging that his blood was due.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Newneſſe of life; here the ſinner acknowledgeth perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to be ſtill his duty; this honours the equity of Gods Commandments. And the Redeemer by making this one of the conditions of the Goſpel-Covenant, hath given his Father his Law back again; he doth not repeal it; no, its ſtill the rule of life, and every Commandment ſtill obligeth a Believer. Chriſt hath only releaſed us from the condemning power of it, not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power of it. We muſt ſtill preſſe after perfection; but though we fall ſhort of it, we ſhall not dye for it: <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us;</hi> but hath left us under the government and command of the Law. The whole matter is excellently expreſſed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. <hi>My little children, theſe things I write unto you that you ſin not; and if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Having thus diſcourſed to the three general points firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and ſhewed that the perſon juſtified is charg'd with guilt: And ſecondly, that he pleads to the charge, (where I have largely opened the nature of that plea) I come now to the third general point, to ſhew how <hi>upon his plea he is diſcharged</hi> or <hi>juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſinner is then actually juſtified, when he is conſtituted or made righteous in Law. Righteouſneſſe is a conformity to the Law; he that fulfills the Law, is righteous in the eye of that Law; he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, within the protection of it; as he that tranſgreſſeth the Law, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, guilty in the eye of the Law, and without the protection of it. Now the Law of the New Covenant runs thus, <hi>He that believeth ſhall not periſh;</hi> ſo that a Believer keeps and fulfills this Law; and therefore <hi>faith</hi> is imputed to him for righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. becauſe <hi>faith</hi> is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the New Covenant, which therefore is called <hi>the Law of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:119240:215"/> faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. in oppoſition to the Old Covenant, called there by the Apoſtle, <hi>the Law of Works.</hi> As therefore <hi>innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or perfect obedience,</hi> would have juſtified <hi>Adam,</hi> had he ſtood by vertue of the Law of Works, or Old Covenant, whoſe tenor is <hi>Obey and live,</hi> for then he had fulfilled that Law; and as his <hi>Diſobedience</hi> actually condemned him by vertue of the ſame Law, — <hi>Diſobey, and dye for it,</hi> Gen. 2.17. So now belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt juſtifyeth by vertue of the Law of faith; for it is the keeping and fulfilling of the Goſpel-Covenant, whoſe tenor is, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> And again, unbelief actually condemneth by vertue of the ſame Law, — <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God,</hi> Joh. 3.18. That is, becauſe the unbeliever is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the protection of the Goſpel, or Law of faith, he cometh not up to its righteouſneſſe; he is <hi>condemned already,</hi> as a <hi>ſinner</hi> by the Law of Works; and yet once more with a witneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as <hi>an unbeliever,</hi> as a monſter that hath twice been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to his own murder; firſt, in wounding himſelf, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in refuſing to be healed: The Law of works includes us all under ſin, we <hi>are all dead,</hi> our caſe was deſperate; but God who is rich in mercy, through his great love wherewith he hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.4. John 3.16.</note> (his immenſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) when we were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, hath ſent his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. And this is that Law according to which he will judge the world; <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Gospel,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2.27. Every Believer therefore, though he wants the righteouſneſſe of the Law of Works, <hi>(viz. innocency)</hi> yet he ſhall not be condemned, becauſe he hath the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpel, <hi>(viz. faith)</hi> which is the New Law in force, according to which God now dealeth with us, and ſhall judge the world at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>And here it will be richly worth our very heedful Obſervation, that although a Believer hath not the righteouſneſſe of the Law of Works, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>herent in himſelf; (for if he had, he were not a ſinner, but ſhould be juſtified by that Law) yet by faith he lays hold upon Chriſts ſatisfaction, which in the very eye of the Law of Works is an unexceptionably perfect, an infinitely glorious righteouſneſſe:

            <p>But that with all requiſite diſtinctneſſe we may apprehend this great affair, let us take a view of ſome of the moſt conſiderable and important cauſes which concur to the producing this excellent effect, the diſcharge and juſtification of a ſinner, and ſtate their ſeveral intereſts and concernments in their reſpective influences upon, and contributions towards it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. How free grace juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note>And firſt, The free grace of God is the firſt wheel that ſets all the reſt in motion. Its contribution is that of a <hi>proegumenal cauſe,</hi> or internal motive, diſpoſing God to ſend his Son, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>That ſinners</hi> (believing) <hi>might be juſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3.24. For Chriſt dyed not to render God good, (he was ſo eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) but that with the honour of his juſtice he might exert and diſplay his goodneſſe, which contriv'd and made it ſelf this way to break forth into the world.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. How Chriſts ſatisfaction.</note>Secondly, Chriſts ſatisfaction is doubly concern'd in our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of God, as a <hi>procatartick cauſe</hi> of infinite merit, and impetrative power; for the ſake of which God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling himſelf unto the world in Chriſt, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the Law of Works, Chriſts ſatisfaction juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us formally, as our proper Legal righteouſneſſe; I call it <hi>our righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe it becomes imputed to us upon our believing; faith being our Goſpel title, by pleading which, we lay claim to all the benefits accruing from the merit of Chriſts performance, to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l effects, uſes and purpoſes, as if it had been perſonally our own; I call it <hi>our Legal righteouſneſſe,</hi> becauſe thereby the Law of God owns it ſelf fully apaid, and acquieſceth in it, as in full reparations and amends made unto it for the injury and diſhonour
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:119240:216"/> received by the ſin of man. We muſt plead this againſt all the challenges and accuſations of the Law: Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is Chriſt that dyed, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8.33. And thus our Legal righteouſneſſe required in the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that of Works, is wholly without us in our Redeemer, yet imputed upon our account.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Goſpel juſtifieth <hi>quâ Lex lata,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. How the Goſpel.</note> as it is the Law of faith; for the very tenor of the Goſpel-Covenant is, Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Faith juſtifieth <hi>vi Legis latae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. How faith.</note> as it is our Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal righteouſneſſe, or our keeping the Goſpel-Law; for that Law ſuſpends <hi>juſtification</hi> upon <hi>believing.</hi> Faith pretends to no merit or vertue of its own, but profeſſedly avows its dependance upon the merit of Chriſts ſatisfaction, as our Legal righteouſneſſe, on which it layeth hold, nor can it ſhew any other title to be it ſelf our Evangelical righteouſneſſe, but only Gods ſanction, who choſe this act of believing to the honour of being the juſtifying act, becauſe it ſo highly honoureth Chriſt; So that as a moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious pen expreſſeth it, the act of believing is as the ſilver; but Gods Authority in the Goſpel-ſanction, is the Kings Coyne, or Image ſtamp't upon it, which gives it all its value as to juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Without this ſtamp it could never have been currant; and if God had ſet this ſtamp on any other grace as love, that then would have been currant, and have juſtified us as faith doth now.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God juſtifieth in a proper ſenſe two ways: firſt,<note place="margin">5. How God.</note> As a Legiſlator; ſecondly, as a Judge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a Legiſlator, enacting by his Soveraign Authority that ſweet and gracious Law of the New Covenant, by vertue of whoſe tenor, every ſinner that believes is juſtified from the guilt of ſin; <hi>from which he could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Acts 13.38, 9. This Law of juſtification by faith, is Gods own act and deed, the great <hi>Inſtrumentum pacis,</hi> between God and man; he hath proclaimed his Letters Patents; the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth hath in the Goſpel (our <hi>Magna Charta</hi>) given his Warrant under his own broad Seal, <hi>that he that believeth, ſhall not be condemned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As a Judge, the God of heaven may in three reſpects be ſaid to juſtifie a Believer.</p>
            <pb n="422" facs="tcp:119240:217"/>
            <p>Firſt, Forthwith upon his believing, God owneth him ſecretly within himſelf, as a perſon juſtified; God eſteems and approves of him as in that ſtate, unto which he hath by believing a title good in Law, an indefeaſible right; a juſtified eſtate emergeth actually, as ſoon as faith, the Law-title thereunto emergeth as a neceſſary reſultance by vertue of the tenor of the Goſpel-Law, which only juſtified vertually, potentially, and conditionally before every Believer in general; but now actually, abſolutely, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular it juſtifieth him as a Believer, when he is ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, At the moment of diſſolution God juſtifieth as the Judge of all the earth, paſſing a private ſentence and award unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life upon every believing ſoul.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But eminently at the laſt day, when the Ancient of days ſhall take the Throne, and in open Court, before the whole Creation, by publick ſentence for ever acquit and diſcharge Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers at that great and laſt Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">6. How Works.</note>Sixthly, Shall I need to adde that Works are ſaid to juſtifie us? <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.4. becauſe they juſtifie our faith, or demonſtrate before God and man, and to our own conſciences that our faith is not a dead and barren, but a true and living one by its fruitfulneſs in well-doing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">7. How the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note>Seventhly, But I muſt not forget, laſtly, that the Spirit of God is ſaid to juſtifie us: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and that two ways; firſt, <hi>directly,</hi> by working faith in the heart, which is one of the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. Now <hi>Cauſa cauſae est etiam cauſa cauſati;</hi> the Spirit juſtifieth as it is the Author of the juſtifying grace. Secondly, <hi>reflexively:</hi> The Divine Spirit clears up juſtification to a Believers conſcience, by diſcovering the truth of faith, by working aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and by ſealing a Believer to the day of Redemption. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſſe with our spirits that we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Thus I have at length done with my firſt Task, the <hi>opening of the Point,</hi> which finds it ſelf ſummed up in this definition. <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a judicial act of God, as Law-giver and Judge of the world, graciousſly diſcharging a Believer for the ſake of Chriſts ſatisfaction, from the condemnation of the Law of Works, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Gospel-Law, or New Covenant which requireth of, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e h from, imputeth unto ſinners faith in Chriſt Jeſus as their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe;</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <pb n="423" facs="tcp:119240:217"/>
            <p>To improve it now, (which was my other task) by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, I infer againſt the <hi>Antimonians,</hi> firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. Refut.</note> That juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not from eternity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe a perſon muſt be charged with guilt before he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or diſcharged; but nothing can be before eternity; if diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd from eternity, when was he charged? what from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity too? then he will be at once eternally charged with, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from guilt, which if any excuſe from a contradiction, they are much wiſer than I am.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My Text convinceth them, actual faith is not from eternity, therefore not juſtification before God; for if faith juſtifie us not before God, but only at the bar of conſcience; then there will be no juſtification at Gods bar at all once mention'd in Scripture; for works do it at mans bar; what is it I wonder that juſtifieth from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? Not Gods decree to juſtifie; for then his decree to glorifie, would make glorification from eternity too; — but <hi>Decreta Dei nihil ponunt actu in ſubjecto.</hi> Gods decrees are immanent acts, and paſſe nothing actually upon the creature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A juſtified perſon was actually under condemnation whil'ſt he was an unbeliever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already;</hi> but he could not be at all condemned, if juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſely affirms that the believing <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were not once, but now were juſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are <hi>juſtified</hi> in the name of the Lord Jeſus, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I infer againſt them, that they are dangerouſly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, in thinking that a Believer is righteous in the ſight of God, with the ſelf-ſame active and paſſive righteouſneſſe wherewith Chriſt was righteous, as though Believers ſuffered in Chriſt, and obeyed in Chriſt, and were as righteous in Gods eſteem as Chriſt himſelf, having his perſonal righteouſneſſe made perſonally theirs by imputa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion. This is their fundamental miſtake, and from hence <hi>(tanquam ex equo Trojano)</hi> iſſue out a throng of ſuch falſe and corrupt deductions and conſequences as theſe.</p>
            <p>That God ſees no ſin in his children; that affliction and death are not proper puniſhments of ſin to Believers; that all future ſins are already actually forgiven, as well as paſt and preſent; that a Believer muſt not pray for the pardon of ſinne, but only for
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:119240:218"/> the manifeſtation of it; that God loved <hi>Noah</hi> when drunk; <hi>Lot</hi> when ſo, and beſides inceſtuous; <hi>David,</hi> when acting A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and Murther; <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was curſing and ſwearing, and denying Chriſt, with as high a love of complacency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as when co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>verſant in the moſt ſpiritual exerciſes of grace; that all which God requires as a ſinners duty in the Goſpel, is to believe that Chriſt dyed abſolutely for him in particular; that this is alone true Goſpel faith; and the doubting or queſtioning this, the unbelief which the Goſpel ſo much condemneth; that to argue our juſtification from our ſanctification, and gather aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love from our love and fear of him, is a Legal principle; that obedience to Gods Commandments is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Believers debt, but that all the obligation which lies upon him to holineſſe, is only the voluntary expreſſion of his love and gratitude to God, not as what is due, but what is comely: And laſtly, (for I ſhould be tyred to name all) that Chriſt hath kept the Goſpel-Covenant for us, as well as ſatisfied the Law; So that not only our Legal righteouſneſſe is without us in Chriſt our Surety, but our Evangelical righteouſneſſe it ſelf alſo.</p>
            <p>Now to pluck up all theſe deſperate conſequences by the root, there needs no more than a right underſtanding of the true and proper notion, and manner of Chriſts redeeming us; it is not by way of <hi>Solution,</hi> but of <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> Clearly thus, our caſe to God is not properly that of <hi>debtors,</hi> but that of <hi>criminal Subjects.</hi> Gods aſpect to usward, not properly that of a <hi>Creditor,</hi> but that of a <hi>Rector and Judge:</hi> The perſon Chriſt ſuſtained, and the part he acted, not in a ſtrict ſenſe that of a Surety, paying the very debt in kind, and ſo diſcharging a bond; but that of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator expiating our guilt, and making reparations to Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice another way than by the execution of the Law. And indeed the very nature of a Law is ſuch, as it is quite impoſſible that the obligation either of its threatning or command, ſhould in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe be fulfilled, by any other than the very perſon threatned and commanded; <hi>alius</hi> here makes <hi>aliud.</hi> If another ſuffer the penalty, the threatning is not fulfilled: Nor if another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the duty, the command; for the obligation as to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies on the perſon threatned, <hi>(noxa caput ſequitur)</hi> and that to duty on the perſon commanded, it cannot be fulfilled in
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:119240:218"/> kind by another, but it ceaſes to be the ſame thing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes another th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng from that in the Obligation; yet it may be ſuch <hi>another thing</hi> (and Chriſts Righteouſneſſe (both active and paſſive) really is ſuch) as the Rector or Judge may accept of with honour, and be ſatisfied with, as if the very ſame thing had been ſuffered and done juſt in the ſame manner, as the Law threatned and commanded it.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt hath paid not the <hi>idem,</hi> but <hi>tantundem,</hi> i. e. not fulfilled the Law (as for us) in kind, but ſatisfied it for us, is moſt evident. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Law obliged the ſinners perſon to ſuffer; Chriſt was no ſinner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All men to ſuffer, foraſmuch as all had ſinned; Chriſt was but one man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The puniſhment due by Law was eternal; Chriſt ſuffered but for a ſeaſon, and is entered into his glory; thus Chriſt paid not the ſame thing that was in the Obligation, but ſomething e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent thereunto.</p>
            <p>This being obtain'd, that the Lord Chriſt hath Redeemed us, not by way of ſolution, or diſcharging a Bond, by payment in kind, but by way of ſatisfaction, or making amends to the injur'd juſtice of the Law: It follows from the reaſon &amp; nature of the thing:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God pardons freely; we are not only beholding to Chriſt for ſatisfying, but to God too infinitely for accepting of any ſatisfaction at all; he might have refuſed it; he had done ſinners no wrong if he had executed the rigour of the Law, without hearkening to termes of Reconciliation. Quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a Creditor doth not pardon the debtor, when the ſurety hath diſcharged the Bond by full payment in kinde; the Debtor is beholding indeed to his friend the Surety, but not at all to the Creditor, who cannot refuſe to cancel the Bond; nay, it were wrong and injuſtice in him if he did.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That none hath or can have actual intereſt in, or benefit by this Redemption, but upon ſuch termes as God and Chriſt have mutually compromiſed in, and agreed to, <hi>viz.</hi> the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel-Covenant above mentioned. See the anſwer to the third quere.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Reaſon hereof is partly from <hi>God,</hi> the injur'd Law-giver of the world; who ſeeing it was at his liberty to accept of
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:119240:219"/> ſatisfaction or no, hath of neceſſity the right to make his own termes, when, and how far forth, and in what manner and method he will condeſcend to admit the ſinner to the actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Chriſts ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And partly too from Chriſt; for as he is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Mediator between God and man, a friend to both parties; nay, a perſon conſiſting of both natures; the offended, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; he is engaged neceſſarily by vertue both of Office and perſon, to eſpouſe with equal tenderneſſe of regard he inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of both parties; for he is really concerned in them both; they are his concernments as well as theirs. True indeed, a Surety that diſchargeth a Bond by full payment in kinde, he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaines and beares only the perſon of the Debtor, minds only his <hi>indemnity;</hi> doth what he doth upon his account, and for his ſake. But our great <hi>Mediator</hi> muſt conſult not only our <hi>impunity,</hi> but his Fathers, yea, and his own honour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, get you hence all you that either yet never did, or that do not now repent, believe, and conſcientiouſly endeavour to obey; here's not the leaſt jot of benefit for you in the caſe you are in, from this Redemption: for how infinite ſoever the merit of Chriſts ſatisfaction is, it conferreth nothing actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon any perſon that hath not actually a Goſpel-claime and title to plead it before God. The immediate effect actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſulting from Chriſts performance, is the procuring the Goſpel-Covenant to be ratified by his Father, as a Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſinners upon the termes propounded, become reconcilable unto God; actually it is of force to all that have, but to none that want the conditions of it. Now the keeping this Goſpel-Covenant, God expects from us in perſon (though by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his Spirit, which he hath promiſed to give to them that humbly and earneſtly ask it of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1.) To af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that Chriſt hath kept the Goſpel for us too, is to utter the moſt ſelf-contradicting blaſphemy and abſurdity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as if he could repent, or believe in himſelf, free, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or cancel our Obligation to obey the Moral Law, by his own obeying it; as if Chriſt had ſo done all, that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to be done on our part. Such ſtrange extreames do ſome men run into, that to avoid Juſtification by works (by an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) are as extravagant on the other hand, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:119240:219"/> the grace of God cannot be free, except the ſinner become either a ſenſeleſſe ſtatue, meerly paſſive, or (which is yet worſe) have a Writ of eaſe to be quite idle, or (wich is worſt of all) a Licence to ſin by Prerogative. Let the Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> chaſtiſe this inſolence. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Shall we ſin becauſe we are not under the Law, but under grace? God forbid.</hi> If Chriſt had obeyed the Law for us in the ſenſe of paying a debt, or diſcharging a Bond, the Apoſtles anſwer could not ſtand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through faith? yea, we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the Law.</hi> When a believer breaks the Law, he ſins <hi>(for ſinne is the tranſgreſſion of the Law)</hi> nay, he cannot break it wilfully, but he breaks the very Goſpel-Covenant (one condition whereof is ſincere obedience) and the guilt of that ſin lieth upon him unpardoned, untill by hearty repentance, and freſh applications by faith to the blood of ſprinkling (which are the only Titles good in Law, the only Goſpel-claimes to pardon) he hath ſued out a new pardon (for actual Remiſſion is only of paſt ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.) according to the tenor of the New Covenant, which is a perpetual Law of pardoning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and believing ſinners, whomſoever, whenſoever, but as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Neither was Chriſts ſuffering like the Cancelling of a Bond, a total diſcharge of us, from ſuffering the penalty threatened in the Law; we dye ſtill, and afflictions are puniſhments ſtill. True, indeed upon Chriſts ſatisfaction made, God and he are agreed, that a believing ſinner ſhould not be puniſhed with the everlaſting deſtructive penalty threatened <hi>(for whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhall not periſh)</hi> but they are not, that he ſhall not be,<note place="margin">John 3.16.</note> for he is, puniſhed with the temporal corrective puniſhments of the threatening, as ſickneſſe, and natural death; yet even theſe (through infinite goodneſſe ſo ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it) prove much more a benefit, than a penalty to a believer.</p>

            <p n="1">1. God might have let man alone, ſeized the forfeiture; as the Tree fell, it might have lain for ever; what obliged God to accept of ſatisfaction?</p>

            <p>Thirdly, It was the Judge himſelf who contrived this way to juſtifie us, and it was at his coſt, he gave his Son; herein God commended his love to us, as <hi>Abraham</hi> once did his faith to God, in that he ſpared not his ſon, his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſon whom he loved. So that if we rightly weigh it, it will appear, that by how much the ſatisfaction is the fuller,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:119240:220"/> by ſo much the pardon is the freer; by how much his juſtice is the more, by ſo much too is his mercy the more glorified, and ſtill, ſtill infinitely the more are we obliged.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Conſider he inviteth thee as a ſinner to come in unto this Goſpel-righteouſneſſe, in the general tenor of his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Whoſoever believes, &amp;c.

            <p>Fourthly, Conſider thoſe ſtanding Monuments of Gods free ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying grace that are on record in the Scripture.

Thou art the man whoever thou art that neglecteſt Goſpel-grace; what fury and raging madneſſe is it that thou art guilty of? Thy ſoul with all its eternal intereſts lies at ſtake, and as if it were neither here nor there, what became of thee for ever, thou <hi>despiſeſt the riches of Gods forbearance, after thy hardneſſe and impenitent heart,</hi>

God ſends his Goſpel proclaiming,<note place="margin">Acts 3.19.</note> — <hi>Repent ye, and be converted, that your ſinnes may be blotted out:</hi> His Miniſters proclaiming, — We then <hi>are Embaſſadors of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> 
               <hi>as though God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled unto God.</hi> Why doſt thou hate thy ſoul, and ſay I will not? why wilt thou not? Is it becauſe it doth not concern thee? or becauſe eternal life and death are trifles, ſmall, little things, not worth thy conſidering? or doth any body hinder thee? No, no; our Saviour gives the true account, <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.</hi> Let me entreat this ſmall requeſt of thee for Gods ſake, for thine own, take the next opportunity, and ſpend half an houre alone; let thy ſpirit accompliſh a diligent ſearch, purſue this inquiry to ſome iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; am I juſtified or no? if not, what will become of me, if it ſhould happen (ſometimes ſuch things fall out) that I ſhould dye now preſently? I cannot promiſe my ſelf that I ſhall ſee to morrow morning. Thus go on, and bring it to ſomething before thou leaveſt; give not over till thou art not only clearly convinced of; but heartily affected with thy
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:119240:221"/> guilt; not only to ſee, but feel thy ſelf to be the man who art undone without an intereſt in this juſtification. Be in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; thou canſt not mock thy God; and is there any wiſdome in mocking and cheating thy own ſoul? What thou doſt, do it heartily as unto the Lord, as for thy life, as one that would not rue thy ſelf-deceiving folly, when it cannot be recalled; and if thou art hearty and ſerious in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou wilt deeply humble thy ſelf before the Majeſty of the Judge of all the earth, with that ſelf-abhorrence and confuſion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes one who feels himſelf (even himſelf being Judge) moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly condemned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou wilt ſollicite and aſſail the Throne of Grace with all redoubled favours, and holy paſſionate importunities of prayer and ſupplication, giving God no reſt till he hath given thee his Spirit, according to his own promiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. To help thee to performe the conditions of the Goſpel-Covenant, plead his own promiſe with him. Wreſtle with him for a broken and clean heart; for faith, for repentance unto life; for theſe are not of thy ſelf, they are the gift of God, let him not go till he hath bleſſed thee with theſe bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus. This will confound every ſinner at the day of Judgment, that when he might have had grace; yea, the Spirit of grace for asking; he either asked not, or if he did, it was ſo coldly, as if he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented enough to go without. Now if thou art in good earneſt, God is I aſſure thee in full as good earneſt as thou; he is ready to meet thee; Try but once whether it be in vain to ſeek him; all that ever tryed, found it good to draw near to God, and found him eaſie to be entreated; he uſeth not to ſend the hungry empty away. He that commands us to <hi>work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling, he it is that worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To them that are the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus. Let me beſeech them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To walk worthy of God who hath called them to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Glory, to adorn their holy profeſſion; take the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> Receive not this grace of God in vain; the intereſt of your comfort obligeth you hereunto;
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:119240:222"/> hereby you will know that you know him, that you <hi>are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
               <hi>that there is no cond mnation</hi> to you, if you <hi>walk not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, but after the Spirit;</hi> and herein will your <hi>Father be glorified,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 15.6.</note> if <hi>ye bring forth much fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To live up to the comfort of their ſtate; 1 John 3.1. <hi>Ye are already the ſons of God, it doth not yet appear what you ſhall be. Who ſhall lay any thing to</hi> your <hi>charge? it is God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8.33. <hi>Go eat thy bread with joy, and put on thy white rayment, God now hath accepted thy works,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.7, 8.</p>
            <p>I conclude this particular (and the whole diſcourſe) with, the happy effects and fruits of Juſtification, which every Believer hath as good a right and title to, as the Goſpel it ſelf, the Word of the God of truth can give him, as I finde thoſe ſweet effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences ſet down in my Text, and the words next following it. — 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>By whom alſo we have acceſſe by faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this grace wherein we stand, and rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> 3. <hi>And not only ſo, but we glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience,</hi> 4. <hi>And patience experience, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hope,</hi> 5. <hi>And hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt which is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</hi>
            </p>

            <pb n="435" facs="tcp:119240:223"/>
            <p>Paſſing ſundry uſeful points, I ſhall pitch only upon that which comprehends the marrow and ſubſtance of both Verſes.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>Every true Believer is a childe of God by Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Adoption.</hi> They were born of God, and ſo were Sons by Regeneration; they had a great priviledge given them, and ſo were made Sons by Adoption.</p>
            <p>In handling this excellent Doctrine, my work ſhall be Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Confirmation, Application.</p>
            <p>The Explication ſhall be firſt general; ſecondly, particular. That reſpects the doctrine of Filiation or Sonſhip in general; this the doctrine of Regeneration and Adoption in particular, they being diſtinct kinds of Filiation.</p>
            <p>For the firſt in general,<note place="margin">General Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. A fourfold Sonſhip.</note> a Perſon may be a Son foure wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Creation; and thus, 1. The Angels, <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. 2. <hi>Adam, Luke</hi> 3.38. 3. Chriſt according to his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. Not that Chriſts Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature was a Son or a Perſon, leſt we make two Sons or two Perſons in one Chriſt. And thus believers are Gods Children, by virtue of their new and ſpiritual Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By Generation; and this is, 1. Eternal or temporary; eternal, as in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 14, 18. compare <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8. Temporary, as in other men. 2. Natural or ſpiritual; natural, as in the Son of God, and the ſons of men, though with infinite diſproportion; ſpiritual, as in Regeneration, <hi>James</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By contract of Marriage;<note place="margin">Or as ſome think, the legal Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the natural Son of <hi>Heli.</hi>
               </note> and thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> was the Legal ſon of <hi>Heli, Luke</hi> 3.23. but the natural ſon of <hi>Jacob, Mat.</hi> 1.16.

            <p n="4">4. By Adoption; which is, 1. External and federal, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. by virtue of external profeſſion and Church-member-ſhip, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.1. compare <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. By Sons of God in this laſt place, may be underſtood either Profeſſors, or the Angels. This Sonſhip may be loſt, as is evident by the Jews

Adoption is internal and real, which leads me to the particular Explication. Only, before I proceed, let me ſubjoyne a word of general Application, in two Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">General Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note>1.

It's applyed to other things beſides man; thus we are ſaid to <hi>Adopt</hi> a name, when we take a new name; to <hi>Adopt</hi> a Plant when we give it a name, as <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> did to the herb <hi>Lyſimachia,</hi> and <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſia</hi> to the herb <hi>Artemiſia;</hi> and thus one branch is ſaid to <hi>adopt</hi> another by inoculation, according to the Poet, <hi>Venerit inſitio, fac ramum ramus adoptet;</hi> which Metaphor, as it is very elegant, ſo it ſerves to illuſtrate the Nature of Adoption, Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24.</p>
            <p>For the thing;<note place="margin">Its nature.</note> Adoption is the acceptance of a ſtranger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Relation and Priviledges of a Son.

            <p n="1">1. Abſolute, namely a ſtate of ſanctification and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Relative, namely a ſtate of Juſtification and Adoption; in which laſt upon our believing, we are by Gods gracious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, accepted into the number, and have a right to all the Priviledges of the Sons of God. Adoption then is our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate, which puts no real worth in the Adopted, though
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:119240:225"/> it preſuppoſe an abſolute ſtate of holineſſe, and a double act. 1. Of free grace, on the Adopters part. 2. Of faith, on the part of the adopted.</p>
            <p>From all hath been ſaid about the Nature of Adoption, note theſe following Corollaries.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Corollary.</note>1. Hence it follows, that Adoption preſuppoſes effectual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Regeneration, Faith, Juſtification, and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are (as it were) its ſecondary foundations; compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, that Believers expect heaven by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Title.<note place="margin">Beſides a Title of Marriage-Joynture.</note> 1. Of Redemption. 2. Of Adoption. See both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſhews how Chriſt is applyed in Juſtification, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a fountaine and garment: how in Adoption, namely as an elder Brother, and Prince of Salvation, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence its evident, our Sonſhip far excels <hi>Adams</hi> filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He indeed was Gods Son by ſimilitude and dependance, but not by ſpecial union and communion with Chriſt the Natural Son of God, as we now are, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence we have the true reaſon, why Gods Name is called upon us (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 14.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.5, 6, 16.) as well as called upon by us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This ſhews why we are in an eſpecial manner of Gods Houſhold, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. not as Baſtards, Sojourners, Borders, Hirelings, Slaves, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.45. <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8. but as his honourable Servants, his Spouſe, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Children. Compare 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.7, 11, 13, <hi>&amp; Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her</hi> 2.7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Wherein doth Divine Adoption differ from, and excell Humane adoption? This Head is a powerful motive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In its properties. 2. In its Priviledges: both which concurre in the ſubſtance, but are diſtinguiſhed here for Doctrines ſake. The Properties of Adoption are foure.<note place="margin">The properties of Adoption.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It's a <hi>precious</hi> Relation, coſt as much as our Redemption, an infinite price; compare 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>&amp; Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to <hi>Acts</hi> 22.28. with a great ſumme Chriſt obtain'd us this Freedome.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:119240:225"/>2. It's an high and honourable Relation. Every Believer is an High-borne Perſon; and as his Birth, ſo his Adoption is high, even as high as heaven, <hi>John</hi> 1.12, 13. It's honourable to be the Son of a King, much more to be the Son of God; to be Gods Servant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.5, 8. (Witneſſe <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) much more to be Gods Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Sonſhip ever riſes or falls with the honour of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>This ſecond property flows from the firſt. That which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious muſt needs be Honourable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4. Whence the ſame word ſignifies both preciouſneſſe and honour,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
               </note> compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's a free Relation. It's free, 1. In an active ſenſe, making its ſubject free, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7. A ſlave adopted, is by that act made a Free man. 2. In a paſſive ſenſe; and firſt as to the Adopter, who is not moved by any thing in the Creature, to beſtow this high favour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. God adopts not out of neceſſity, but liberty; who can compel or neceſſitate him? not out of indigency (he had a Natural Son, and many created Sons, who were very like him, and liking to him) but out of redundancy of goodneſſe. 2. In a paſſive ſenſe its free alſo as to the adopted, without, yea, againſt their deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings. We may all with ſhame take up the words of <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſheth,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.28. This property flows from the two former; that muſt needs be freely given, which is ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and honourable. None is worthy to be the Son of God, but only the Natural Son of God. He that cannot deſerve a bit of bread, much leſſe can deſerve this Divine Relation; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an helliſh, not an heavenly Sonſhip, each of us being by Nature children of <hi>Belial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It's a permanent Relation. Once a child and for ever ſo. <hi>John</hi> 8.35. A Servanr, a created Son, a Natural Son may ſometimes be turned out of doors, witneſſe the Angels, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10, 12. But an adopted Son is never caſt off, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 89.26, 30, 33, 34. and that upon the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the freeneſſe of Adoption; God choſe them not for their well-deſervings, nor will he reject them for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings; if unworthineſſe foreſeen, did not hinder the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:119240:226"/> of Adoption, then unworthineſſe preſent ſhall not hinder the compleating of Adoption; and thus the fourth Property flows from the third.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Divine immutability is engaged in the Covenant of grace, of which Adoption is one great Branch. Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.29. <hi>&amp; Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If any thing unchild them, it muſt be their Apoſtacy: But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They can fall no further than their Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fall they never ſo foully, he can mend and recover them as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He will never permit them to fall finally and totally, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. And what Parent would caſt off a ſon, had he this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over him? We never caſt off a childe unleſſe incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;<note place="margin">Deut. 21.18, 19 20.</note> but to our heavenly Father, no childe is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">The Priviledge of Adoption. Likeneſſe to God.</note>2. Divine Adoption differs from, and excels humane, in its Priviledges, as well as in its Properties.</p>
            <p>The General Priviledge is, Likeneſſe to God. All Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Children bear their Fathers Image, as <hi>Gideons</hi> Brethren d d his,<note place="margin">And 1. In ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</note> 
               <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.18. They are like God, 1. In holineſſe. 2. In dignity. In holineſſe; as Chriſt beares their Natural, ſo they bear his Spiritual Image. Compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7. <hi>&amp; Rom.</hi> 8.29. Their principles and actions prove them the children of their heavenly Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. This one truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childs moſt Profeſſours, who look not at holineſſe as a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: with <hi>Machiavels</hi> Prince, they like the ſhew of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but fly virtue it ſelf as a burthen: Such bewray themſelves to be Baſtards; but let genuine children remember, that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not only a duty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16. but alſo a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Many hope to be like God hereafter, who affect not to be like him here; but genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Sons affect the one, as well as they hope for the other, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, 3. The hope of the former, will at fartheſt dye with themſelves, <hi>Job</hi> 8.13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. In dignity.</note>Next, Gods adopted children are like him in Dignity. This Dignity appeares,</p>

To his <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acs,</hi> his Heires, his Conquerours, God gives his all; not half (with <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi>) but his whole Kingdome.

            <p>The Nature of Regeneration will appeare more diſtinctly, by comparing it more particularly with natural Generation;<note place="margin">The termes of conveniency.</note> and 1.

            <p n="2">2. They agree, 2. In the manner of production. In both there is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A conception; Chriſt ſpiritual (as well as perſonal) is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conceived by the power and overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt. This holds true in other Generations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.23. unleſſe the ſeed of the Word be received and retained, there can be no new man, no good and honeſt heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a formation. Gods Art is wonderful in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our outward man, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 139.14, 15, 16. but far more ſtupendious in the formation of our inward man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. which is no mean part of the myſtery of godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Quickening, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.36. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſpiritual motion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Longing. Sometimes the Parents long, ſometimes the childe; here both Parents and childe; How doth God, Chriſt and his Miniſters long for the natural mans converſion? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.34. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.8. Never did a teeming woman long more for fruit, or deliverance, than theſe do for a new-born babe in Chriſt. I, but this is not all, the Babe himſelf longs alſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Compare 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Travaile with paine. Oh the pangs of our ſpiritual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. do not increaſe them by ſticking in the birth! <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.13.

Every new-born babe comes crying into the world: The New, as well as the Old Creation, travails with paine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22, 23. The foundation of the ſecond Temple, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid in weeping, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.12, 13. and God ſtill layes the beames of his Chambers in the waters, &amp;c. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 104.3. Each of theſe may be a taſte and touch of our new-birth; and prove the greateſt part of Profeſſors to be in an unregenerate eſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They agree in the Subject produced, the new creature with new actions and new Priviledges. As in Generation, ſo in Regeneration, there is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A new nature with new principles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. In Generation there is ſtill the ſame firſt matter, but under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſucceſſive formes; and when ever a new forme is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the Subject is called new: ſo in Regeneration, <hi>Old things paſſe away, behold all things b come new,</hi> ib.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are new actions or operations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>&amp; Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 24. There's a new eye, a Circumciſed eare, a ſpiritual taſte, appetite, language, motion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly. There are new priviledges. According to the degrees of Generation the degrees of Priviledge vary; a plant hath higher Priviledges than an Element, a beaſt than a plant, and a man than a beaſt: But how tranſcendent are the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the new man? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22.—24. See more of this Head in the Explication of Adoption.</p>
            <p>Next follow the termes of difference or diſſimilitude,<note place="margin">The termes of difference.</note> which may be applyed to each of the Heads of Agreement, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Birth far excelling the firſt Birth, even in thoſe Termes wherein both agree. But I paſſe that for brevities ſake, and ſhall content my ſelf to note the difference of both Births in four Properties. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Regeneration is <hi>rare:</hi> As few men are generated in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of all other creatures, ſo few perſons are new borne, in compariſon of thoſe who are borne: No more are Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, than ſhall be ſaved, and thoſe are but <hi>few</hi> in compariſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.14. compare <hi>Luke</hi> 13.23.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:119240:229"/>2. Its far more ſecret than the natural birth; compare <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>&amp; Coloſ.</hi> 3.3.<note place="margin">John 3.4, 9.</note> Whatever <hi>Solomon</hi> might underſtand of Generation, both he and every man elſe is very purblinde in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of Regeneration; nor could the wiſeſt or the holieſt (excepting Chriſt) ever fathom either the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or this myſtery of godlineſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Regeneration is conſtant and progreſſive; once born, and ever born; once born, and always bearing. Its like the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Son of God, who was begotten from eternity, and is ſtill a begetting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.8. In natural Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſooner or later, death marrs the birth; but its other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in Regeneration, he that is born again ſhall never dye; the ſoul and body may part; but Chriſt, grace and the ſoul ſhall never part.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Regeneration is ſpiritual; the very ſoul it ſelf is carnal, if compared to the Spirit of Grace communicated in Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>John</hi> 3.6. The grace of Regeneration, though but a quality, far exceeds the moſt refined ſubſtance, humane or angelical, as is evident in the Apoſtate Angels, who by their loſſe of holineſſe became Fiends and Divels; yea, worſe than nothing.</p>
            <p>This for the Explication of the termes in general, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.<note place="margin">Proof of the Doctrine.</note> I proceed to the proof and demonſtration of the doctrine; In the management whereof I ſhall need to go no further than my Text.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Adoption and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Sonſhips.</note>And Firſt, It will appear from the Text, that the Sonſhip by Adoption and Regeneration are diſtinct filiations, though never ſeparated as to the ſubject; for whoever is a Childe by Adoption, is alſo a Childe by Regeneration, and <hi>contra.</hi> That they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct filiations is evident;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are noted as diſtinct; <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their foundations are diſtinct; the one is of gift, and by actual faith; the other is of birth. There's a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, applied to Adoption, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which expreſſes Regeneration; compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2.14. <hi>&amp; Gal.</hi> 4.4. where both words are joyned together. An adopted perſon is made a Son; but he is not born a Son as to the Adopter. Its evident then theſe two relations are diſtinct.</p>
            <pb n="447" facs="tcp:119240:229"/>
            <p>Secondly, It appears alſo from the Text,<note place="margin">2. Believers are Gods children by both. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that every Believer is a childe of God by both theſe filiations; Namely, by Adoption and Regeneration. The former is evident, becauſe Believers are dignified with a ſonſhip which follows as a priviledge upon their faith, and that by deed of gift, which can be no other than the Sonſhip of Adoption; for the Sonſhip of Regeneration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes actual believing. The ſecond is as evident; for they who are born of God muſt needs be Sons by Regeneration, as he that is born of man, is a Son by Generation: But Believers are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſaid to be born of God, as is evident by comparing both the Verſes of the Text, and therefore are Gods Sons by Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as well as by Adoption. If you ask further, Whence it is that Believers are Sons of God by this double filiation; the Text holds forth a foure-fold ground, partly explicite, and partly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite.</p>
            <p>The firſt ground is free-grace; Adoption is a gift therefore not deſerved; Regeneration cannot be deſerved; 1. Becauſe all merit is impoſſible to the creature;<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 2. Becauſe before Regeneration the creature was in a ſtate of Corruption; and what can a corrupted creature deſerve but wrath and curſe?</p>
            <p>The ſecond ground is Chriſts merit, whence probably the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the priviledge of Adoption is ſingularly attributed to Chriſt, becauſe he purchaſed our Adoption as well as our Regeneration, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6.</p>
            <p>The third ground is Divine glory, which is the end of all Gods Works, much more of ſuch gracious Diſpenſations as are Regeneration and Adoption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43.21.</p>
            <p>The fourth ground is encouragement unto faith by the favours and priviledges vouchſafed unto Believers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. And theſe are more implied than expreſſed in the Text, yet flow naturally enough out of it.</p>
            <p n="1">

Are all Believers Gods children, &amp;c? Then no unbeliever is a childe of God either by Regeneration or Adoption: Not by Regeneration, as having no life of grace, which initially infuſed is the new birth. And hence every unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is,</p>
            <pb n="448" facs="tcp:119240:230"/>
            <p>Firſt, A dead man, as dead in Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. dead in ſin, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. dead under wrath and curſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. dead in expectation and fear, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.27. Whoever hath not a part in the ſecond Birth, ſhall be ſure to have a part in the ſecond Death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Unbelievers being not children of God, can expect nothing from God as a Father. Now the ſtate of unregeneracy excludes them from both filiations; for unleſſe God be a Father by Regeneration, he will be no Father by Adoption. Nor can unregenerate perſons be children by Adoption becauſe they have no faith. Hence they are Orphans, and ſo helpleſſe; for God will be no Father to ſuch fatherleſſe Children. But are they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fatherleſſe? No verily; therefore</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They have woful parents; namely, ſin and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. wrath and curſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 14. and laſtly, Satan, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. who is alſo their God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. as God is the Believers Father. Oh miſerable wretches as deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of an heavenly Father; and more miſerable as the woful children of moſt helliſh and curſed Parents, who have nothing to make over to them but ſin and cutſe, and that they will do with a vengeance.</p>

            <p n="1">1. They think not of, rejoyce not, glory not in, nor walk up to the dignity of Divine filiation; but are mean-ſpirited, and ſink almoſt at every difficulty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14, 15. the natural Son of God did not ſo.</p>

As a Father God pities his children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. and ſpares them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. Parents bowels yearn moſt towards their weakeſt Children; and ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. We pity a Childe that is poyſoned, not ſo a Serpent to whom poyſon is natural. If thou favour not thy ſelf in ſin, God will favour and pity thee becauſe of thy very infirmities, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fatherly proviſion; God will never fall under the foule aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of being worſe than an Infidel, which he blames ſo much in unnatural Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. This priviledge Relates to the neceſſities of Gods Children. Its well obſerved by a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writer, <hi>To have no neceſſity at all, is Gods ſole priviledge; To have neceſſities immediately ſupplied, is the happineſſe of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints; To have neceſſities mediately ſupplyed, is the comfor of Saints on earth; To have neceſſities without any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, is the miſery of the damned.</hi> Now Divine proviſion under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for all theſe ſupplies, mediately here, immediately hereafter. Fatherly proviſions are fourefold, anſwerable to the proportionable wants of Children.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for maintenance; and God provides no leſſe than all good things for his Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.9, 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. eſpecially the beſt things. Compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11. <hi>&amp; Luk.</hi> 11.13.</p>
            <pb n="452" facs="tcp:119240:232"/>
            <p>Secondly, A calling. Gods care extends to the particular calling of every one of his Children, much more to their general calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Marriage; their civil marriages are made in heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.14. much more their ſpiritual match with Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6, 9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, an inheritance: Though their portion be not here below, yet God gives them portion in things here below, which ſweetens and ſanctifies all their enjoyments, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.5. But the beſt portion here is nothing to their heavenly inheritance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fatherly protection, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6, 10, 11, 12. which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeaſonable for time, ſutable for kinde, proportionable for degree, univerſal againſt every danger, and conſtant as long as danger threatneth: immediate by God himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.3. Or mediate by Creatures, Ordinances, Providences, Comforts, Croſſes, Graces, Temptations, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fatherly education, with all requiſites thereunto; for which this Father alone can undertake; as</p>
            <p>Firſt, Docibleneſſe; God alone can make his children apt to learn:</p>
            <p>Secondly, Teaching, by precepts, direction, examples, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, manuduction, exerciſe and inclination, making them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to learn, <hi>Job</hi> 36.22.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Correction, and that</p>
            <p n="1">1. By chaſtiſements, bodily or ſpiritual.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By croſſing their will and worldly deſigns.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By teaching them to croſſe their own wills, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. This correction is a great branch of the Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30. — 34. All theſe priviledges God affords them <hi>gratis.</hi> Children pay nothing for proviſion, protection, education, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.26.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fatherly Communion. A Father is very familiar:</p>
            <p>Firſt, With his little Children.</p>
            <p>Secondly, With his grown Children. To aſſure us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, God is pleaſed to take upon him a threefold Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:119240:232"/>1. Of a Friend.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of an Husband.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of a Father; compare <hi>John</hi> 14.21, 23. <hi>&amp; Revel.</hi> 3.20. This for the grounds of Conſolation, which every one is ready to catch at; but only children have a right unto: This makes way for the laſt head, and a grand caſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; Namely, How ſhall I make it out that I am a genuine Son, and not a Baſtard or Stranger? In managing this diſcovery I ſhall mix together the tryals of both filiations, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Adoption.</p>
            <p>And firſt, Sons are like their Father;<note place="margin">1. Tryals of our ſonſhip.</note> they are uſually the Natural and Moral Pictures of their Parents. This in its meaſure holds true of Gods Children, who reſemble their Father.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In life, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Children honour their Parents,<note place="margin">2. Obedience is both a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative tryal, <hi>John</hi> 8.47.</note> 
               <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. and that</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Reverence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By Obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By pliableneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. Slaves are driven, but Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are <hi>led.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. By coming oft into, and delighting in his preſence; Compare <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. <hi>&amp; P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al.</hi> 139.18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may know our Sonſhip by our ſpirit; every Childe of God hath</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Spirit of faith and dependance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Spirit of prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. The firſt cry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the New Birth, is <hi>Abba, Father, Acts</hi> 9.11. God hath no Childe but can ask his heavenly Father bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Spirit of Evidence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.30. The Spirit alwayes witneſſeth, though his witneſſe be not alwayes heard.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Spirit of liberty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. of liberty from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin, Satan, the world and fear, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.15. of liberty to Chriſt and duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Spirit of waiting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.</p>
            <pb n="454" facs="tcp:119240:233"/>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, A Spirit of love; not only to God and his children, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.2. but alſo to our very enemies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45. Hence Gods Children, (like their Father) are peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9.</p>
            <p>To conclude; Art thou like God? doſt thou honour God as a Father? haſt thou the Spirit of God? then mayſt thou comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably claime and enjoy all the forementioned priviledges, and infinitely more than heart can conceive, or tongue expreſſe. Art thou covetous? here is a treaſure for thee; Art thou ambitious? here is the higheſt honour. Art thou voluptuous? here is an Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of pleaſure. Art thou in danger? here is an Ark and Haven of ſecurity; all theſe in the hand of filiation, and that above any created deſire or comprehenſion, with infinite ſecurity to all eternity.</p>

               <hi>Faith</hi> which we believe is the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> or any word of God; yea, the <hi>eſſential Word</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.23.</note> the promiſed Seed, the Object of Faith, is by that word under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by learned perſons. 1. <hi>Fides qua creditur, Faith</hi> by which we believe; and this (to begin at the remoteſt and meaneſt) is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Firſt, <hi>Without knowledge,</hi> the ignorant implicite <hi>Faith</hi> and profeſſion of many owning Chriſt as the founder of their Order and way; but this is not right, which only diſtinguiſheth Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from others.</p>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>How Salvation is the effect of Faith.</hi> Here conſider theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>natural aptitude</hi> and fitneſſe of this grace of <hi>Faith,</hi> to be made uſe of in the way of ſaving man that had broken the firſt Covenant, and could not be ſaved thereby; yea, ſo fit is faith as to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> upon ſuppoſition of Gods ſaving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by a <hi>New Covenant in the hands of a Mediatour,</hi> and Surety, and his Righteouſneſſe: There muſt be an appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:119240:243"/> of that to the ſinner, and making all his own; and this muſt be by voluntary acceptance; ſelf-confidence and boaſting muſt be prevented; now faith alone could do this, as before hath been ſhown.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>inſtitution of God</hi> making this fitneſſe of Faith uſeful and effectual to this end <hi>Salvation;</hi> for be it never ſo fit, yea, neceſſary, ſo that Salvation could not be brought about without it; and ſuppoſe <hi>(per hypotheſin impoſſibilem)</hi> which yet could not be, that man had believed upon the Redeemer, and God had not ſaid, <hi>Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Faith had not reached Salvation;<note place="margin">Phil. 3.9.</note> therefore it is called the <hi>righteouſneſs of God,</hi> which is <hi>by Faith in the Son of God,</hi> even of his find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and appointing. Even as Sacramental ſignes, are and muſt be fit to repreſent what they are appointed for; (as <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 23. <hi>ad Bonif. Oportet ſimilitudinem habeant earum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, quarum ſunt Sacramenta, quam ſi non haberent, non eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sacramenta)</hi> yet they work not <hi>naturally,</hi> but by <hi>Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> as a means of Faiths maintaining and increaſe; ſo <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Dignity and Merit of the object of Faith</hi> is to be conſidered; for though it be ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Receiving</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>mercedem,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> rendreth it) the <hi>end,</hi> the <hi>reward of your Faith;</hi> yet is it not <hi>of merit;</hi> for the way of Salvation by <hi>Faith,</hi> is altogether <hi>of Grace,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> induſtriouſly and abundantly proveth. <hi>Faith</hi> therefore may be conſidered either <hi>qualitativè,</hi> or <hi>relativè;</hi> in it <hi>ſelf,</hi> or with reſpect to its <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> Now not as an <hi>habit</hi> in us, or <hi>act</hi> exerted by us, (though acting, not dead faith ſaveth) not as a <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the firſt Commandment doth faith ſave, but through the <hi>righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> which it apprehends and appropriates: in it ſelf it is the moſt indigent and ſoul-emptying grace that is, and cannot by its own merit do this; for it is <hi>due,</hi> being by God commanded, (<hi>Luke</hi> 17.10.) <hi>imperfect</hi> in it ſelf; for who attaines the higheſt degrees of faith? and if perfect in its kind, yet but an imperfect Righteouſneſſe, being the fulfilling but of one Goſpel-command.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Why</hi> there is this <hi>undivided connexion between Faith and Salvation</hi> The <hi>Prime reaſon,</hi> and that which it muſt be ultimately reſolved into, is the <hi>good pleaſure of God,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:119240:243"/> to which he worketh all things. There is nothing in <hi>faith</hi> bearing proportion to this effect and attainment, ſo that we may admiringly ſay, <hi>Even ſo Father, becauſe it pleaſeth thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>The Firſt ſhall be a more <hi>general Note.</hi> True and ſaving faith <hi>receiveth a whole Chriſt upon judgement and choice on Gods term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Lord</hi> to rule as well as <hi>Jeſus</hi> to ſave, the object of <hi>Faith</hi> in the Text; no <hi>ſeparating what God hath joyned,</hi> and to have a divided Chriſt, not a whole Chriſt; ſalvation, but not ſelf-denial, &amp;c. True Faith is a <hi>conſiderate</hi> thing, (that which hath leaſt depth,<note place="margin">Mat. 13 5.</note> ſprings up moſt ſuddenly) the ſoul ſits down, and weigheth, and caſteth up all accompts, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things together, miſery by ſin, undonneſſe in ſelf, termes of ſalvation, ſelf-denial a fundamental one, taking

            <p>Secondly, True and ſaving Faith is <hi>uſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r'd in by godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> in a good degree, though they are farther compleated afterward upon the ſenſe of Gods pardoning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting love;<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.63. Mark 1.15. Acts 20.21.</note> 
               <hi>Then ſhalt thou be aſhamed, &amp;c. Repent and believe; Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> this is Goſpel order: The inconſiſtency between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hab. 2.4.</note> is evident in that oppoſition of the <hi>ſouls lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up,</hi> and <hi>living by Faith;</hi> and the hinderance of the Jews believing, <hi>John</hi> 5.44. The Centurions and womans <hi>Faith</hi> were attended with eminent <hi>humility.</hi> Did not <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>godly ſorrow</hi> accompany and bring in <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> could not be our <hi>School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt.</hi> This ſhutteth out that eaſie, merry, proud <hi>faith,</hi> that ſprings up without the dunging of <hi>humility,</hi> or watering of <hi>ſorrow according to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, True and ſaving Faith is <hi>abiding and perſeverant,</hi> and this upon ſuppoſition of temptations and aſſaults; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a mock-faith may have a continuance, and men dye in a pleaſing dream of ungrounded preſumptuous confidence.

            <p>Fourthly, True and ſaving Faith is <hi>growing,</hi> though this growth be not alway diſcernable, or alike: That prayer for <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Faith,</hi> flowed from the very nature of Faith;<note place="margin">Luk. 17.5.</note> it is the <hi>good fight,</hi> which muſt be carryed on to a compleat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; <hi>running a race,</hi>

            <p>Fifthly, True and ſaving Faith is <hi>Purging;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 1 Rom 8.1, 4</note> 
               <hi>purifying their hearts by Faith: Believing</hi> and <hi>walking</hi> not after the <hi>fleſh</hi> are joyned: where there is <hi>Faith</hi> (and much more aſſurance of Faith) there will be <hi>heart and body cleanſed and waſhed;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, True and <hi>ſaving faith</hi> hath <hi>other graces accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it,</hi> in a good meaſure, with a proportionable encreaſe, ſtrength and activity; I know ſome are more eminent for this, others for that grace; as <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>meekneſs, Job patience, Abraham Faith,</hi> &amp;c. yet in good meaſure muſt other graces accompany; for this is an indiſpenſable duty, to <hi>add to Faith
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:119240:245"/> temperance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>patience, brotherly kindneſſe.</hi> Faith with many other graces, are called in the ſingular number (<gap reason="foreign">

Beſides that the growth, and ſtrength, and activity of other graces have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon it; both as it pleads with Chriſt in prayer for all, and pleads with the ſoul to act, ſtir up, and abound in all. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams faith</hi> had <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> accompanying it; there will be <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> for he that believeth <hi>will not make haſt.</hi> See more tending to this under the fifth <hi>effect of faith.</hi> Let not men ſpeak of their faith then, when other graces are no way ſuitable.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, True and <hi>ſaving Faith</hi> is <hi>working and fruitful;</hi> though <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good works</hi> are not the form of it, (as the Papiſts plead) yet it alway hath love accompanying.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.6. James 2.17.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, True and <hi>ſaving Faith</hi> truſting God for the greater, will <hi>truſt him for leſſer mercies.</hi> To them that <hi>through Chriſt do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.21.</note> this will ſeem forcible arguing, and a neceſſary infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up</hi> (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) <hi>for me,</hi>

               <hi>how will he not with him give me alſo all things freely?</hi> God hath made all ſorts of promiſes to true Faith; and accordingly many of the Servants of God have expreſſed confidence in God when things have gone worſt with them; they would not be <hi>afraid

Though I know natural timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs, and living too much the life of ſenſe may occaſion ſome worldly fears in a Believer; as boldneſs of temper, careleſneſs, falſe confidence may much bear up an unbeliever: Yet in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their pretences to faith are queſtionable (I might ſay their faith is but pretence) who ſay they can truſt God with their Souls, but will not truſt him with bodies and eſtates.</p>

               <hi>Repentance is a grace ſupernatural.</hi> It is <hi>a grace</hi> in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>ſupernatural</hi> in its Authour, Original, quality and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Repentance is a <hi>grace in its nature;</hi> not only as it is <hi>freely given us of God,</hi> without the leaſt merit of ours, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as it is a gift <hi>animating and enabling unto action;</hi> That which I intend you eſpecially to note, when we ſay Repentance is a <hi>grace,</hi> is this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that it is an <hi>habit, power, principle, spring, root, and dispoſition;</hi> not a bare, ſingle, and tranſient action, as the Papiſts, and ſome ignorant ſouls do imagine: Repentance is different and diſtinct from all penitential acts; ſighing, ſelf-caſtigation, and abſtinence from all ſinful actions, are fruits and expreſſions of repentance, but not the grace it ſelf; for that diffuſeth it ſelf into the heart, and diſpoſeth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituateth, and enableth to all acts of ſorrow for, and ceſſation from ſin: The repentance which is given of God, is not an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but power, principle, and frame of ſpirit: <hi>The power and principle</hi> is divine, but <hi>act and exerciſe of repentance</hi> is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; God plants the root whereby man brings forth fruit worthy repentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.8. Repentance is no other but a ſpirit of grace, animating men to mourn, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not the work of an houre, or a day, but a conſtant frame, courſe and bent of the ſoul, on all renewed guilt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afreſh, and bringing forth renewed acts. When the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God doth ſmite the flinty heart of man, it loſeth its ſtone and hardineſſe, becomes pliable to divine pleaſure, is inclined to relent, and prone to diſtill its heavenly dew: and
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:119240:250"/> therefore it is called a grace; as in its nature Repentance is a grace, ſo in its Original and operation it is <hi>ſupernatural;</hi> a grace <hi>freely given from above,</hi> not acquired by any means or merit of our own, but ſpringing into the ſoule by the meer good Will of God, and immediate power of the holy Ghoſt; however Repentance muſt be acted, it cannot be acquired by man; it lieth out of the reach of humane arme, and muſt be the effect of an Almighty hand, even the influence of God himſelf; there is not in man the leaſt merit of condignity or congruity, that can engage divine juſtice to beſtow it: No; it is a <hi>good and perfect gift,</hi>

               <hi>The believing ſinner is the ſubject of Goſpel-repentance.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever repenteth, chargeth himſelf with guilt, and muſt needs be a ſinner. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had no repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no ſin; and the Lord Jeſus ſaith, he came not to <hi>call the righteous, but the ſinner to repentance,</hi> Matth. 9.12.

Gods common complaint of impenitent <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is, <hi>they believed not,</hi> Pſal. 78. Then faith muſt needs unlock and releaſe the ſoule unto its returne to God; for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariorum eadem eſt ratio, the reaſon is</hi> the ſame to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls faith <hi>incendium poenitentiae,</hi> the ſpur <hi>of repentance;</hi> and the Scripture doth ſuggeſt to <hi>be the pumpe of repentance.</hi> Pſal. 130.4. <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou ſhouldeſt be feared.</hi> Hence it is that the <hi>objects of faith</hi> become <hi>arguments,</hi> and the <hi>promiſes of grace, perſwaſions to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Jer. 3.13. The approach of the Kingdome of God, is the only argument urged by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.2, 4, 17.</note> to enforce Repentance; mercy apprehended, animateth the miſerable ſinner to returne to God. <hi>Iſrael</hi> mourned, but made no returne untill <hi>Shecaniah</hi> cryed, <hi>There is yet hope in Iſrael concerning this thing, Ezra</hi> 10.2.

            <p>I well know many Divines aſſert the precedency of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto faith; but to my judgment it is more than probable, yea, poſitively clear, that <hi>in order of time,</hi> Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are infuſed together into the ſoul; <hi>in order of ſenſe,</hi> and mans feeling, Repentance is indeed before faith; but <hi>in Divine method, and the order of nature,</hi> Faith is before Repentance, as the Fountaine is before the Stream.</p>
            <p>But it is objected that the order of Scripture doth ſet Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before faith; ſo <hi>in preaching,</hi> Mark 1.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.19. And Repentance is required as the qualification which muſt entitle to the promiſes, remiſſion of ſinne is <hi>onely offered to the penitent;</hi> ſo that Repentance is the reaſon of faith, and ground on which we believe ſin is pardoned.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this Objection; I ſhall propound unto your Obſervation three Rules which make a full and ready reſolution to it.</p>

            <p>Let me then diſmiſſe this Rule with this Note or Obſervation.<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>Faith in its exiſtence and eſſential acts, but without its reflexion, fruits and effects, is the foundation and fountain of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Such therefore <hi>on the one hand,</hi> as apprehend and aſſent unto the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and are ſometimes affected with, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for their ſin, but <hi>do not accept of Jeſus Chriſt as tendred to be Lord and Saviour,</hi> do fix their Engine too low to force the waters of Repentance into the ſoul; yet this Divels faith may produce a <hi>Judas</hi> Repentance; for an Hypocritical Repentance is the reſult of an Hiſtorical faith. And <hi>on the other hand,</hi> he that ſeeks aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his ſin pardoned as an argument of Repentance, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the effect both cauſe and effect, and concludeth himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a condition not needing Repentance, whilſt he pretendeth to enforce it; but the true frame of a Goſpel Penitent, is by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith to ſee ſalvation (through the ſatisfaction of Chriſt our Saviour) extended to ſinners, himſelf not excluded; and ſo clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with, accepting of, and appropriating to himſelf the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tenders of grace, and terms of the Covenant, to proſtrate

In a word, the penitent ſoul recedes and turns from all ſin.

            <p>Firſt, <hi>The vent of grief;</hi> they give eaſe and quiet to the penitent perplexed <hi>ſoul;</hi> conviction concealed, is like a burning bile, in which the ill humours in a mans body do rancour and ſwell, burn and pain the whole body, as willing to be gone, and only giveth eaſe by being lanced, open'd, and let out by confeſſion and ſupplication; guilt concealed, is like the winde confined in the bowels of the earth, making roaring ruptures and dreadful earthquakes; unconfeſt ſin is the ſpring of horror, and principle of all amazement; <hi>David</hi> found it ſo on his ſad experience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3. <hi>When I kept ſilence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long, but I acknowledge mine iniquity;</hi> untill then he could find no comfort.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The vomit of ſin,</hi> ſo <hi>Origen</hi> did uſually call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for it is the loathſome rejection of ſin, an eaſing of the ſoul by evacuation of what burdened it; caſting up with grief and pain what we caſt off with deteſtation; confeſſion is the emptying the ſoul of ſin by expreſſion of all paſſion againſt it ſelf; accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and condemnation turn the heart and whole man againſt ſin; ſhame makes us ſhun evil; the penitents in the Primitive times did confeſſe their iniquities to God in the ſight of the Church, and if they again relapſed into the ſame ſin, and apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized to their old courſe, were ſaid to <hi>return with the Dog to his vomit, and the Sow to her wallowing in the mire,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.22.</p>

            <p>We ſee then that there is much reaſon why the Goſpel-penitent muſt be a confeſſing ſuppliant; but before I paſſe this Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let me briefly propound unto you the Rules which muſt guide our Confeſſion, evidencing and accompanying our Repentance; and they are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Confeſſion muſt spring from Conviction, and ſpread it ſelf unto Condemnation.</hi> Soul-ſenſe of guilt unto ſighing, muſt make the tongue ſpeak of it unto ſhame; compunction of ſpirit muſt be expreſſed by ſupplication: <hi>Then ſhall you remember your own evil wayes, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves;</hi> our common Tranſlation reads it, But <hi>ſhall judge your ſelves not worthy to live,</hi> as other and better Tranſlations read, <hi>for your iniquities, and your abominations,</hi> is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.13. Confeſſion of ſin wh ch ſprings not from ſenſible conviction, and ſpreads not to ſelf-condemnation, is an hiſtorical narration, &amp; verbal recitation of ſin; like the curſory reading of an ordinary Inditement, no penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al confeſſion of ſin; the penitent prodigal begins with <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and ends with <hi>I am not worthy;</hi> it is an eaſie matter for <hi>Saul</hi> to ſay I have ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, I have tranſgreſſed the Commandment of the Lord, but ſtill he ſtaves off the ſenſe of it, and not only diſputeth againſt reproof, but at length diverts his conviction by an Apology,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:119240:262"/> 
               <hi>I feared the people, and obeyed their voice,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.24. Conſcience is placed in us, the Law ſpread before us, and ſelf-ſcrutiny impoſed on us, as precurſive to our repenting confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; we are required <hi>to judge our ſelves,</hi> which imports to be convinced, we deſerve to die, and ſo to put halters on our own necks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God alwayes, and men ordinarily muſt be the object of our confeſſions and ſupplications.</hi> Whatever ſin is committed, God is the object of it; his holy Law is violated by it; though ſome ſins are committed againſt God immediately, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not unto men, as all breach of the firſt Table of the Law, and miſcarryings of acts of Religion; yet all ſins againſt men, are alſo againſt God, who is no leſſe concerned in the ſecond than the firſt Table of the Law. If <hi>David</hi> ſin againſt <hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> her chaſtity, or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> his life, yet he muſt confeſſe unto God, <hi>Against the have I ſinned, and wrought this wickedneſſe in thy ſight;</hi> however the treſpaſſe is againſt man, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion is againſt God; the ſin which is committed againſt God, is to be only confeſſed unto God, not unto man; but the ſin which is committed againſt man, muſt be confeſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and likewiſe unto men; to God alwayes who can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the eternal puniſhment; to men ordinarily, as when the Church is <hi>ſcandalized,</hi> or the particular perſon is <hi>offended and damnified;</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 5.16.</note> and in this laſt caſe, reſtitution muſt be added to our confeſſion,<note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> 
               <hi>Zacheus like;</hi> where we have wronged any, we muſt make acknowledgement and reparation; and in all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to men, when we come before God, we muſt conſider, <hi>whether our brother hath ought againſt us,</hi>

               <hi>and go and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled;</hi> the God that binds men to <hi>forgive till ſeventy times ſeven times,</hi> binds the offendor ſo, often <hi>to return and ſay, I have offended.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 17.4.</note> The auricular confeſſion of the Papiſts, is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuperſtition, and evil; but particular acknowledgements of ſin to God, and ſometimes to men, is duty indiſpenſable; in vain doth <hi>Saul</hi> ſay to <hi>Samuel, I have ſinned,</hi> whilſt he never ſeeks to God for the pardon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Confeſſion of ſin and prayer for pardon muſt be free, and not extorted.</hi> The natural, not forced language of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; the confeſſion of conſtraint, falleth equally under ſuſpicion with the unrequired accuſations of malice, both which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:119240:262"/> falſe; true repentance doth convince of the ſinfulneſſe of ſin, and conſtraine the ſoule to confeſſe it with candor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and freedome, as weary of it, as the ſtomach of nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous matter, that it naturally without any co-action caſts up. Confeſſion ſprings from the Saints, as <hi>Elihu</hi> his plea for God againſt <hi>Job, I am full of matter, the Spirit of the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth me,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Job,</hi> Job 32.18, 19, 20. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the wicked is conſtrained, and no longer doth he cry to God, than he is under the cudgel of his judgements, or on the Rack of his own conſcience; ſo <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his plagues, and <hi>Judas</hi> his anxiety may extort an <hi>I have ſinned;</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the children of God muſt be ſometimes pinched and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into their complaints, yet their cry is natural, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions free and voluntary, a ready eccho to the leaſt reproof,<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.5.</note> and deſiring that the righteous may ſmite, and God ſhew them their iniquity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Confeſſion and ſupplication muſt not be more free than full;</hi> not ſtraitned any more than extorted; ſin muſt be confeſt, not only <hi>in general, and in the lump,</hi> with a <hi>Lord have mercy upon us miſerable ſinners;</hi> but in its particular <hi>species and parts;</hi> as <hi>Iſrael, We have forſaken the Lord, and ſerved Baal;</hi> in <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.10. and <hi>we have to all our ſins added this evil, to ask us a King,</hi> to go about to change our Government, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.19. not only <hi>open,</hi> known, hainous, and flagitious offences, but even <hi>ſecret and particular luſts.

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Confeſſion muſt be made with confidence and ſupplication in hope of pardon;</hi> the true penitent is proſtrate before God as a Father, not as a Judge; men may confeſſe and be hanged, but the children of God cry with <hi>Shecaniah,</hi> We have tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but yet <hi>there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing,</hi> Ezra 10.2. they pray in faith, <hi>Father forgive us our trespaſſes;</hi> not in feare; <hi>mercy my Lord mercy.

            <p>The <hi>NECESSITY</hi> of Repentance.</p>
            <p>Repentance in the very nature of it, which hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, doth appeare <hi>uſeful and neceſſary.</hi> It is not a thing baſe and vile, to be deſpiſed, neglected, and contemned, but <hi>admirably excellent,</hi> and to be prized and purſued by every ſoul that is ſtudious of true excellency; for however proud men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely deem and damne it as a puling property, and puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous temper of ſpirit, below a man, on every ordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſit drooping and penſive, and not dare to do as nature dictates, and good company requires; yet the children of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome well pondering what hath already been ſpoken of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee it ſparkle with ſuch ſplendid notes, as engage them to eſteem it, and employ themſelves in it night and day; making it their work and buſineſſe, ſaying as <hi>Tertullian, Nulli rei natus niſi poenitentiae, I am born for nothing but to repentance.</hi> For from what hath already been ſpoken, it is apparantly excellent: in its</p>

            <p>Thus then we find that there is much of ſtrength in this Argument, even above a thouſand Arguments to enforce Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; if but right reaſon keep the Throne, what reply can be made, or reaſon rendred, why the call of the Goſpel ſhould not be obeyed, whilſt it pleadeth with ſo much clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for our repentance from the conſideration of the death of Chriſt?</p>

This is ſure a profitable proper Argument to perſwade repentance; which provokes unto the Preaching of it; and therefore the ſame Apoſtle doth in <hi>Acts</hi> 7.30, 31. urge it; but now he <hi>commandeth all men everywhere to repent, for that he ha h ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day wherein to judge the world in righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.

And it is to be obſerved, that thoſe in <hi>Athens</hi> who repented not at <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching, <hi>mocked when he made mention of the reſurrection, and last judgement.</hi> But certainly there is much in the day of judgement to move the hardeſt heart, and moſt ſtubborn ſinner to repentance: the ſame Spirit which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of ſin and of righteouſneſſe, <hi>convinceth alſo of judgement;</hi> for the day of judgement anſwereth all the ſinners pleas, whereby he defendeth and encourageth himſelf in ſin; for it aſſureth of <hi>certaine detection and conviction of ſin.</hi> It is a day which alloweth not the leaſt encouragement from ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; for therein every mans deeds muſt be made manifeſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good or evil; nay, the <hi>very ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be laid open;</hi> and ſinful thoughts themſelves muſt then be judged; the day of judgement <hi>determineth a period to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,</hi> and denieth the duration of its props and Pillars, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and pleaſures in the world;</hi> determining all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin, to be at the beſt but <hi>pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon;</hi> calling on rich men to <hi>howle and weep, though they live in pleaſure on earth,</hi> in James 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

            <p>Thus then the Goſpel doth by plain and powerful arguments call unto repentance, and witneſſe its neceſſity: But yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</p>

            <p>The Goſpel helps us to <hi>the Spirit that worketh Repentance.</hi> The Miniſtry of the Goſpel is the Miniſtry of the Spirit; this awakeneth the moſt ſleepy conſcience, and ſhaketh the moſt rocky heart; this makes <hi>Herod heare John gladly,</hi> and the

            <p>Here are two great points contained in this Text.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>P ace is a high duty, rich bleſſing, and ſingular benefit that a Chriſtian is bound to follow, purſue, preſſe after, and labour for, and that with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The duty is preſſed ſtrictly in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, rendred here with the ſofteſt <hi>follow;</hi> and in other places it is rendered to <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.1. Phil. 3.12. to <hi>purſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.11. to <hi>preſſe unto,</hi> Phil. 3.14. And we have a full proof for all; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as in you lieth live peaceably with all men.</hi> We muſt ſee there be no default on our part (that all the world is not in peace) but that we follow, purſue, preſſe hard after peace, (as far as poſſibly we may, and to the utmoſt that lies in us) and that with all men; ſo ſaith the Text alſo.</p>
            <p>But I muſt leave this ſmall <hi>Pomegranate</hi> peace, that I may ring out the <hi>Saints Bell</hi> of holineſſe, the ſound and force where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I heartily pray may reach all your hearts, (not ears) or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the ſound thereof in all your hearts may be heard in the Lords ears, (not ours) <hi>that ye dye not;</hi> yea, that Religion dye not; otherwiſe I may fear that <hi>Englands</hi> paſſing Bell is tolling at the departure of our glory, and we may call the next generation <hi>Iohabod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the other, and preſent point is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>true and real holineſs is the grace; the duty, the ſtate, the trade which every Christian is bound to follow, purſue, preſs after with might and main, as he ever thinks to look God in the face.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and spirit, perfecting holineſſe in the fear of God;</hi> perfecting holineſſe] what is that, but to follow it, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, purſue, preſſe hard to it? ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Be ye holy as God is holy;</hi> there is as much or more, purſue, follow it
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:119240:284"/> ſtill, that you take up with no ſcant meaſure, no low degree of it.</p>
            <p>I call it, 1. <hi>A grace,</hi> and ſo it is; yet more; it is not one ſingle grace alone, but the conjunction of all graces. To ſay it is a ſtar, is too little, it is a conſtellation; or the <hi>way of holineſſe</hi> is as the <hi>lactea via,</hi> altogether ſtarry, ſo holineſſe is all grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I call it <hi>a duty,</hi> and ſo it is; but much <hi>more,</hi> it is the ſum and Epitome of all duty. All duties of the firſt Table are referred to <hi>holineſs,</hi> as all of the ſecond Table to <hi>righteou neſs,</hi> Luke 1.75. Yea, duties of the ſecond Table are call'd <hi>holineſſe,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I call it <hi>a ſtate;</hi> it is not an act or habit, but <hi>a ſtate;</hi> nor a ſtate of a Chriſtian, but <hi>the ſtate</hi> of Chriſtianity, the ſtate of conſiſtency and continuance or growth; there are ſome ſtates we paſſe through, (as the man through Infancy, childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, youth, but abides in the ſtate of Manhood) we paſſe through the New birth to be born no more; of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.9, 11. Rom. 8.15.</note> 
               <hi>to dye no more;</hi> of <hi>bondage, to fear no more;</hi> but in this ſtate once, we muſt perſiſt, perſevere, live, dye in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I call <hi>it our trade,</hi> and ſo it is our nobleſt profeſſion, and courſe of life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Be holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.11. <hi>What manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation!</hi> This is the trade and buſineſſe we ſhould ply in the whole courſe of our lives.</p>
            <p>Now it may be asked what this holineſſe is? And I would anſwer, and (if the time would bear it) open, the definition, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <q>True holineſſe is that inward, through and real change, wrought in the whole man, of a formerly vile ſinner, by the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">What holineſs is.</note> whereby his heart is purged from the love, and his life from the dominion and practice of fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I call it a <hi>change,</hi> and ſo it is; it is not from nature, cuſtome, education; it is not an habit, form, but a change. <hi>Christiani fiunt non naſcuntur, creantur non generantur;</hi> and a mighty and manifeſt change it makes, it is therefore call'd a <hi>new birth, new creation,</hi> a
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:119240:284"/> 
               <hi>new creature, reſurrection, &amp;c.</hi> Is there not a change when a childe is born? when a dead perſon raiſed? a blinde man receiveth ſight?</p>
            <p>Yea, whatſoever is call'd holy, is <hi>eo nomine,</hi> changed from its common uſe; when a <hi>perſon,</hi> or a <hi>garment,</hi> or a <hi>place,</hi> or a <hi>veſſel,</hi> or a <hi>day</hi> were called holy, all ſuch were changed, as to their uſe, ſerving now for ſacred and Religious Services; ſuch is Soul-holineſſe, a Soul-change.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three great changes</hi> wrought in a Chriſtian at times.</p>
            <p>Firſt, One in <hi>Juſtification;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Ne impute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> when a guilty ſinner hath <hi>ſin taken away,</hi> that it is not imputed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond in <hi>Sanctification;</hi> when a ſinner living and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in ſin, <hi>hath ſin taken away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Ne regnet.</note> (the power of it) that it doth not <hi>raign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is in <hi>Glorification;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Ne restet, aut omnino ſit.</note> when the ſanctified perſon hath <hi>ſin taken away,</hi> (all remainders of it) that it hath no <hi>being</hi> left.</p>
            <p>Now though the firſt and laſt of theſe are both <hi>perfect</hi> changes, and Sanctification is not perfect here; yet upon ſome account, ſome have called that change wrought in Sanctification the greateſt change of the three; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with Juſtification, Juſtification is a change of the ſtate, not of the perſon; a change without, not within the man.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sanctification,</hi> there is a real change, and that within the man.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Glorification</hi> alſo is a perfect change, (it being the higheſt ſtate of the three) but the change is not ſo great as in Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; glory and grace differ but gradually, there being no oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between them, as between grace and ſin. The change is not ſo different between the Morning light and the Noon-day brightneſſe, as between the Morning light and the Midnight darkneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I call it an <hi>inward</hi> change] to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>civil hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A through change]</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>restraining,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> grace, which produceth ſome particular and partial change, but not a total and univerſal.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="558" facs="tcp:119240:285"/>4.

            <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>This is Gods great deſigne; therefore ſhould be ours.</hi> It is the greateſt deſign God hath upon his people in all he doth to and for them. All the <hi>immediate</hi> acts of God, and all his <hi>mediate</hi> tend to this.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Becauſe it was a <hi>Doctrine</hi> which <hi>God</hi> was <hi>able</hi> to bring to paſs. This is ſet down in the words of the Text, <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</hi> The emphaſis lieth in the words <hi>with you:</hi> Why ſhould <hi>you,</hi> O <hi>King Agrippa,</hi> who art a <hi>Jew,</hi> and believeſt in the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> and that he made the world out of nothing, think it incredible for <hi>this God</hi> to raiſe the dead? indeed it may ſeem <hi>incredible and impoſſible</hi> to the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> who are guided onely by <hi>Natures Light;</hi> but as for <hi>you,</hi> who <hi>believe all things which are written in the Law and Prophets,</hi> why ſhould <hi>you</hi> think it either impoſſible or incredible that <hi>God</hi> ſhould raiſe the dead?

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>bodies</hi> of the <hi>juſt</hi> ſhall riſe out of their <hi>graves,</hi> as out of their <hi>beds,</hi> with <hi>great joy and rojoycing;</hi> and therefore it is ſaid, Iſa. 26.19. <hi>Awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt.</hi> As ſoon as ever they <hi>awake,</hi> they ſhall <hi>ſing and rejoyce:</hi> The godly ſhall come out of their graves, as <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the <hi>Whales belly;</hi> as <hi>Daniel,</hi> out of the <hi>Lyons Den;</hi> as the chief <hi>Butler</hi> out of Priſon, to be reſtored to all his former dignities; and as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was taken out of Priſon to be made <hi>Lord of Egypt:</hi> So ſhall the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the <hi>Saints</hi> be taken out of the grave, to be <hi>crowned</hi> with everlaſting glory. And who can ſufficiently expreſs the great joy and rejoycing that will be, when the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> ſhall be re-united together; when the <hi>Soul ſhall come down from heaven, to be married again to its former body?</hi> Look what ſweet embracements there were between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> when they firſt ſaw one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after that <hi>Jacob</hi> had thought he had been dead, and look'd upon him as one raiſed from the dead; ſuch, and a thouſand times more will be at the <hi>ſouls re-poſſeſsion of the body:</hi> Look what joy between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> came out of the cave to him; and what <hi>embracements</hi> between the <hi>Father</hi> of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> when his <hi>Father ran to meet him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, and kiſsed him; and ſaid, My Son was dead, but now he is raiſed again;</hi> ſuch, and much more, will there be, when body and ſoul meet together. O how will the <hi>ſoul bleſs God for the body,</hi> which was an <hi>inſtrument</hi> to it in the <hi>ſervice of God!</hi> and how will the <hi>body bleſs God for the ſoul,</hi> which was ſo <hi>careful to get an intereſt in Chriſt, and to get to be juſtified and ſanctified!</hi> and how will both <hi>body and ſoul admire the free grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, who hath pickt them out to be heirs of ſo much mercy!</hi> Surely, we ſhall never underſtand the greatneſs of this joy, till we do taſte of it.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The next wreath in this Crown, is the perception of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs to the ſatisfaction of our love as all other deſires; this is the great Sabbath of loves, and the ſoul like a Phaenix ſhall lie down in a bed of Spices, and live like a <hi>Salamander</hi> in thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note> 
               <hi>Coals of Juniper,</hi> deſiring exſtatically to be in its beſt ſelf, and archetypon God himſelf.<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.14.</note> 
               <hi>But who of us can dwell with devouring flames? who of us can lie down with everlaſting burnings?</hi> even the love wherewith God loveth himſelf, and loveth his Saints; but then we ſhall find his love ſtrengthening of us to love him with his own love; and theſe dull earthly hearts of ours by beholding of that Sun, ſhall be converted into fixed Stars, reflecting back his own glory; we ſhall then feel the ſweetneſs of Gods Electing love from all eternity; the love of our bleſſed Jeſus, which was<note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note> 
               <hi>stronger than death;</hi> yea, we ſhall then enjoy the Spirit of love, who is<note place="margin">1 John 4.8.</note>

               <hi>loving-kindneſs is better than life.</hi> And as one ſayes of <hi>Paul,</hi> that as Iron put into the fire becomes all fire, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> enflamed with charity and love, becomes altogether love. If
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:119240:335"/> The Philoſophers ſay the reaſon of the Irons cleaving to the Loadſtone ſo conſtantly, is becauſe the pores of both bodies are alike, and ſo there are effluxes and emanations that ſlide through them, and unite them together; now this will be the magnetiſm of heaven, that our wills ſhall perfectly fall in with the Divine Will, and nothing ſeem good to us, but what is good in Gods eſteem, ſo that we ſhall then need no threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to drive us, nor promiſes to lead us; but Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will ſo perfectly attract us, that we ſhall be naturalized to God and goodneſs, and be no more able to turn off from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable ſweetneſs, than the Loadſtone is to convert it ſelf to the Weſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt wreath is the reſult of both the former; from viſion and fruition of infinite truth and goodneſs, reflected in the Center of the ſoul, ſprings up delight to all eternity; Heaven is nothing but<note n="*" place="margin">Gaudium de veritate. <hi>Aug. Alicubi.</hi>
